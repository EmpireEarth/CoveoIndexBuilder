The ResultList component is only used by <strong>#main-search</strong> instance of Coveo on the page.</p> \n<p>The two other search boxes use TopFieldSuggestion component but are implemented as Standalone/Global Search Box from the April release (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/JsSearch/Standalone+Search+Bo\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/JsSearch/Standalone+Search+Box</a> - <em>it looks like formal implementation of the concept is in the May release</em>)</p> \n<pre><code>   var searchInterface = Coveo.$(\"#searchbox\");\n         searchInterface.on(\"afterInitialization\", function () {\n             searchInterface.on(\"newQuery\", function (e, args) {\n                 // DC - Commented line below, see: https://answers.coveo.com/questions/113/when-keyboard-is-visible-on-ios-6-7-clicking-coveosearchbutton-does-not-execute-search\n                 // var currentKeyword = searchInterface.coveo(\"state\", \"q\");\n                 var currentKeyword = Coveo.$.trim(Coveo.$('.CoveoQueryBox').val());\n                 if (currentKeyword != \"\") {\n                     window.location.href = searchPage + \"#q=\" + encodeURIComponent(currentKeyword);\n                 }\n             });\n             \n         });\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>I've disabled <em>history</em> on the <strong>#searchbox</strong> - the HistoryController get's tripped-up setting the hash with multiple Coveo instances on a single page. </p> \n<p>With the code above the hash get's set & the <strong>#main-search</strong> on the page (with <em>History</em> enabled) fires the query. But the problem is that after <strong>#searchbox</strong> sets the hash it <em>also</em> fires a query, logs analytics and returns a results object.</p> \n<p>As of now - To prevent this, I'm leaning towards patching the QueryController.ExecuteQuery of that particular #searchbox so it fires a \"newQuery\" event but does little else. </p> \n<p><strong>Anyone have any better ideas</strong> ?</p>\n                </div>",
