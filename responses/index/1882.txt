It's not exactly what we want but it will do the job I think. I made a new computed field that has this format \"number|last name\" where the number is 0 or 1 stating whether the user has the directory enhancement or not. When we sort by the field it becomes naturally sorted by directory enhancement then last name. The reason why this isn't 100% what we want is the end-user can change the sort from ascending to descending and the enhanced directory listings go to the end of the list. Ideally we would still want them at the top of the list only they are sorted by last name descending.</p>\n<p>Is there a better way to Achieve this Google Addword like feature?</p>\n\n                </div>",
