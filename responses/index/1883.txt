This is because the whole process is Ajax driven and does not make server trips to Sitecore when you update your search term. It would seem that the only way to hook into the search term (#q=) would be through a JS event handler that would make a clientside Ajax request to Sitecore and return some JSON that we could place on the page. Do you possibly have any documentation, how we could hook into a specific JS event that is triggerred when a new search has been requested so that we could do such a process?</p>\n                </div>",
