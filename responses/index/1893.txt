After the user makes a few selections I want to dynamically add a facet to the page. I know I can add the new facet to the query using the groupBy property, but I also need to create the DOM and let JSUI know to use it. </p> \n<p>Right now the way I have this working is that the page is loaded with all possible facets, and I use JS to enable and disable the facets. This is giving me really bad UI experience as the browser locks up whenever any facet is selected. I want to change this so that the page is loaded with just the basic facets and the new facets are added gradually.</p> \n<p>Thanks</p>\n                </div>",
