My understanding is that the Coveo server currently uses the \"Sitecore Connector\" (not sure what version) to pull the data from the Sitecore site and write out the indexes based on that. So nothing is installed on the website that is specific to building Coveo indexes. My questions is, if we upgrade the site to 8.1 (which I understand does not supported the Sitecore Connector), and we keep the current Coveo index in place using the current Sitecore Connector and pull mechanism, will it still pull the data and build the indexes? If not, what has changed to make this not work? Are there any other options where we could keep this pull method in place vs. installing Coveo for Sitecore on the site to push the data to the Coveo server?</p> \n<p>Thanks?</p>\n                </div>",
