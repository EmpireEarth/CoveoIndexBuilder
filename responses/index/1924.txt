For some reason I see that some data is not indexed after rebuilding the index with the Coveo for Sitecore 80.0772. Is there a limit of the indexed documents with the trial version?</p> \n<p>Is there a log file where I can see why some data is not indexed to start troubleshooting the issue?</p> \n<p>Also, I created a package of data and I installed into my sitecore and then I publish it. But I see that coveo is not indexing anything.</p> \n<p>Thanks</p> \n<p>Please let me know.</p> \n<p>Thanks </p>\n                </div>",
