We've gone through a number of settings (disabled cache limits, not render collapsed sections, not display standard fields) and finally taken dotTrace dumps of the action. What we've come to find is that the items displaying the problem have a mutlilist with search field and the calls to Coveo are taking 4+ seconds. The primary case we're working on has a start item specified and filters by 3 different template IDs. There are 2500 items under the start item.</p> \n<p>Can anyone suggest any thougths about how we can look into speeding this up?</p> \n<p>I appreciate any suggestions/help.</p> \n<p>Thank you Ryan </p>\n                </div>",
