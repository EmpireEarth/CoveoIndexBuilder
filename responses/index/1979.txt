Initially, the script wrote to just one field and that worked fine. I then added a second field and wrote a fixed string to it. After rebuilding the index, only the second field was present when I looked at the results.</p> \n<p>Should I be able to write to multiple custom fields from one script ?</p> \n<p>Thanks Jim </p>\n                </div>",
