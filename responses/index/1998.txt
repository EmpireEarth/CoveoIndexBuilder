The Sitecore instance has been around for many years, and has been worked on by many teams, and as a result, has a lot of templates, with a lot of fields.\nAlso, there are 5 'web' targets, in addition to the core and master database.</p>\n<p>We're using Sitecore 7.1, so we have 7 Coveo indexes. (This would be much more if we were using Sitecore 8+).\nEach index is using the default setup for each database, where everything is indexed.</p>\n<p>As we've been rebuilding these indexes one by one, we've noticed a severe slowness to each rebuild.</p>\n<p>Looking at the logs, the indexing won't actually start until all of the fields for the database have been added to the respective field set in Coveo.\nThe logs initially would say:-</p>\n<pre><code> Adding 500 to the field set.\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>but are now saying</p>\n<pre><code> Adding 1 to the field set.\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>every 5 minutes. \nI assume this slows down because for each field, it's checking all of the existing fields to make sure it's not already added. It may even be checking fields in existing field sets...as my final index has now taken over a day to create the field set, and hasn't even started indexing yet.</p>\n<p>Is the large field set the case of our slowness (completed web indexes show around 9600 fields in each field set)?\nIs there any way to speed this up?\nWill rebuilds be quicker after the initial one, because the fieldset won't have to be recreated?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n                </div>",
