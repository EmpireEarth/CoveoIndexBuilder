After checking some forums, If I want to use contains operations in my queries I have to change how my fields are indexed in the file Coveo.SearchProvider.config and make it facetable like:</p> \n<pre><code> <fieldType fieldName=\"First Name\" isFacet=\"true\" settingType=\"Coveo.Framework.Configuration.FieldConfiguration, Coveo.Framework\" />\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>Notice that I am not changing all the schema, just adding some new fields, etc.</p> \n<p>Anyway, suppose that I am working with another two guys, and we need to sync all the customization that we are doing in the Coveo index in the file Coveo.SearchProvider.config. I think that is not a good idea to syn all the file Coveo.SearchProvider.config because some developers could use different ports/rabbit user credentials in their environment, etc. The ideal solution should be to shared only the customizations that each developer are doing with respect of the index.</p> \n<p>Is there a way to have a configuration file in Sitecore that describes the index only? I meant to have the index configuration section outside the file Coveo.SearchProvider.config or have another file that just extend the index configuration section of the file Coveo.SearchProvider.config that contains the customizations?</p> \n<p>Or what is the best practice for that?</p> \n<p>Thanks a lot</p>\n                </div>",
