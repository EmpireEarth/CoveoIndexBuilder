Sitecore and CES are hosted on different servers. As of right now, after following the instructions, I'm receiving a couple errors on the diagnostic page.</p> \n<p>When I'm remoted into the CMS server and I check the diagnostics page I receive an error on \"Coveo Search REST Endpoint ()\" of \"Unable to connect to the remote server\". </p> \n<pre><code> System.Net.WebException: Unable to connect to the remote server ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond [IP address]:1080\n    at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.DoConnect(EndPoint endPointSnapshot, SocketAddress socketAddress)\n    at System.Net.ServicePoint.ConnectSocketInternal(Boolean connectFailure, Socket s4, Socket s6, Socket& socket, IPAddress& address, ConnectSocketState state, IAsyncResult asyncResult, Exception& exception)\n    --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\n    at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetResponse()\n    at Coveo.SearchProvider.Applications.StateVerifier.<>c__DisplayClassd.<GetRestEndpointState>b__c()\n    at Coveo.SearchProvider.Applications.BaseVerifier.VerifyComponent(Func`1 p_VerifyMethod, String p_ComponentName)\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>When I connect to the Sitecore instance remotely, from my local machine, I receive the above error as well as the same error on the Coveo Security Service section. </p> \n<p>From my local machine, in a browser, I can hit <code>http://[CMS host name]/coveo/rest</code> and I receive the default JSON response with 0 results. When I go to <code>http://[CES Master Server]:8080/rest/search</code> I get the standard JSON response. So this leads me to believe the search endpoint is configured correctly, but then the error above states otherwise.</p> \n<p>Any ideas of a direction to look in? </p>\n                </div>",
