We published the sitecore items - reindexed the site ( and whole index as well ) and found that none of the French Belgium version of the items were indexed. ( Neither Dutch Belgium ) I verified this with a simple search from the Coveo Administration tool Index browser.</p> \n<p>First question is how do we check the logs for indexing operation? </p> \n<p>I created a new index for the same target database just for an experiment. I rebuild the new index and found that French version of the items from Belgium site is now indexed. What could be the reason to the old index not having the French version of the items?</p> \n<p>Earlier this week we had a similar issue with Japanese site. But choosing \"republish\" while publishing the items and a rebuild index fixed the issue. This fix was not good for the French site</p> \n<p>Thanks for the help as always </p>\n                </div>",
