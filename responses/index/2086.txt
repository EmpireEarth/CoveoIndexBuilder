For example, person 1 can choose multiple values from Happy, Sad, Angry, Frustrated etc. All of this goes to our DB in a special table indexed by user_id and mood_type.</p> \n<p>Now we would like to bring these mood types into Coveo for searching as facets. A user should be able to select Happy, Sad, Frustrated from the sidebar and see Person 1. </p> \n<p>I am trying to understand how this would work with custom fields while indexing. </p> \n<ul> \n <li><p> Do you create a separate field for each mood type and mark Person 1 as having that mood type? For example a custom field called happyMood and set that to Happy or Y for Person 1? </p> </li> \n <li><p> Or do you create a custom field called moodType and set it to a long string containing Happy; Frustrated; etc.? </p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>How does one create a facet in that case? Any help or guidance would be great!</p>\n                </div>",
