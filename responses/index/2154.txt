To account for vagueness in the submission, I am allowing for a partial match, i.e. \"neuro\" would return items for both \"neurology\" and \"neurosurgery,\" whereas deeplinking in would imply an exact match, i.e. \"neurosurgery\" would only match against \"neurosurgery\".</p> \n<p>I'm seeing some rather inexplicable weirdness though - if I submit the form with \"Internal Medicine\" as my query, I'll do my CONTAINS search and return ~200 results (expected). If I do it as an EXACT match on the same field, I return upwards of 1400, the vast majority of which have nothing even remotely matching in that field. I inspected coveo console just to make sure the traffic mirrored what I was seeing and received the following:</p> \n<pre><code> Query (@fspecialtygroups5872==\"Internal Medicine\") performed by coveo\\admin [Sitecore Security Provider for mysite]. 1401 results in 0.453 seconds.\n \n Query (@fspecialtygroups5872*=\"*Internal Medicine*\") performed by coveo\\admin [Sitecore Security Provider for mysite]. 217 results in 0.141 seconds.\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>I'm hitting the same server and the same index and got the same results when querying through the CES Admin tool as well. </p> \n<p>Does anyone have any idea what I'm missing here?</p> \n<p>Thanks!!</p>\n                </div>",
