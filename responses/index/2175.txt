Muddying the waters is our plan to upgrade Sitecore from 7.0x to 7.5x in the next few months. As we understand it, Sitecore upgrades must be done at 0.1x intervals so, from 7.0x to 7.1x and so on.</p> \n<p>I realize that we'll have to reinstall Coveo (version specific) once the Sitecore upgrade is complete. But are there any best practices we should keep in mind while doing this? Any major incompatibilities that we should be aware of, or is it recommended to finish upgrading Sitecore before installing Coveo for Sitecore? </p>\n                </div>",
