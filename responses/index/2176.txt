This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details. </p>\n<p>in fact opening localhost/adminservice returns a 404. I read that this might be related to credentials so I repaired the installation the the enterprise search and provided a local user with admin privileges but that didnÂ´t fix the issue.\nOne thing that I thought weird was that whenever I try to repair the installation the installer shows that the admin service security option is disabled like if that was never done.\nAlso all coveo services are running.\nAny ideas what could be causing this?</p>\n<p>thanks</p>\n\n                </div>",
