I'm trying to understand how security providers are created in the Coveo Administration Tool. It appears that these are created automatically when you initially build an index from Sitecore and the name is based on the InstaneName setting in the site's Web.config. My first question is, is this the case? </p> \n<p>My next question is around problems that occur when there is an invalid security provider. Right now, when I try to build my index from Sitecore, the index is not building. I notice that there is this WARNING in the system log (I changed the security provider name in the example below - replacing the site name with \"SitecoreSiteName\"):</p> \n<p>WARNING 03:42:30 PM The security provider \"Sitecore Security Provider for PUBLIC-CD-SitecoreSiteName\" has encountered an exception: class Merlin::SecurityProviderNotRegisteredException: Security Provider \"Sitecore Security Provider for PUBLIC-CD-SitecoreSiteName\" not registered. </p> \n<p>I don't see this security provider listed in the list of security providers in the Coveo admin. I'm trying to figure out why warning this is showing up. And could it be the cause of why the index isn't building? </p>\n                </div>",
