We wanted to know the way to achieve the search result as existing sitecore content is bit complex. We are using coveo REST API to get results.</p> \n<p>We are having three template Product, Equipment and Recommendation. Product and equipment templates are standalone templates which holds the all information of product and equipment. Recommendation is templates where we are mapping product with equipment like multiple product with multiple equipment.</p> \n<p>Currently we have created three different sources to crawl product, equipment's, and recommendation.</p> \n<p>Here is the question, if user searching for particular keyword, we need to show the product details along with recommended equipment's. Since both are in different sources, how to combine the results and return the results in single query. We do not want to send multiple request to coveo server.</p> \n<p>Please let me know if the question is not clear.</p>\n                </div>",
