(\"Auto Suggestion Keyword\").</p>\n<p>Can someone explain to me what this code is actually trying to match?\nDo all the items, fields etc need to be the same?</p>\n<p>And also, even though I re-named them all back... does anyone have any idea why this is no longer working for me?</p>\n<p>Update: I found that the code is outputting \n'fautoz32xsuggestionz32xkeyword91555', \nbut the index field name in CES is\n'fautoz32xsuggestionz32xkeyword40212'.</p>\n<p>Any idea why the hash is different?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n                </div>",
