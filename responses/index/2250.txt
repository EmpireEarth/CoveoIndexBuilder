Could not find details about the issue. My server is running multiple application and I have tried following so far:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p> Made sure Application pool for search admin application is started </p> </li> \n <li><p> Restarted the Website</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>But these didn't not fix the issue yet. However, from even log, I found application error on ModelTagger.exe but I can run FacetAdminTool. In the front end I can access \"edit this interface\" in Do More but If I change something I get blank page with \"Object moved to here.\" then page stuck on nothing.</p> \n<p>I need to resolve this issue as soon as possible to make some changes through admin page. Any helpful suggestion please.</p>\n                </div>",
