While it seems to be working - i.e. no errors are generated when the index is run. I'm not seeing results them show up in the CES backend.</p>\n<p>There are 2 tasks I'm trying to performt he first is to remove anonymous access to the document and the second is to add read access to multiple roles.</p>\n<p>When I don't include code to remove anonymous access and just apply the the new access roles it will index the documents, but the access roles are not showing in the permisssions tab in the indexed documents search. </p>\n<p>I found this link that suggests that the permissions property should not be touched. It is public so I didn't know if this is an unimplemented feature or if I'm going about things the wrong way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SC201504/Using+the+Coveo+Pipelines\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SC201504/Using+the+Coveo+Pipelines</a></p>\n<p>Can you suggest a way without changing permissions in the SItecore tree to get these permissions added to the document?</p>\n\n                </div>",
