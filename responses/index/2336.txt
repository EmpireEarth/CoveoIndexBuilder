When I came to step four under Creating the Quick View Device, the instructions state to \"Activate the Content tab and find the Conditions field in the Detection section.\" The Conditions field did not exist in this section, and there was no reference to any needed package for that feature to show. After some time I found the Mobile Device Detector on the Marketplace which had this field, and matching rules according to the instructions. I set up the layout, device, standard values on desired templates, tweaked the configs, verified anonymous access to the preview, even named my layout and device verbatim, everything according to instruction, and of course when re-indexing the new layout is not used. With everything now in the desired setup, I can only assuming I'm using an incorrect Marketplace package. Any other thoughts or routes of troubleshooting would be appreciated.</p>\n                </div>",
