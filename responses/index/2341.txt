I'm passing a valid user account/password and other values to the form fields that were downloaded in the Forms section. However, when I test a secure page from the Form details screen in the source, it is returning the login page (not authenticated). The page is supposed to redirect to the login page, then redirect back to the original page after authentication. I also used Fiddler to make sure I am capturing and passing the correct form values. Am I missing something? Or will this not work?</p>\n                </div>",
