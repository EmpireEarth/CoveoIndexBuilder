I also have this working in local, test, staging, authoring environments. I'm assuming this is a permissions problem as the code is the same throughout all envs and I've manually tested the query (minus QRE) within CES. </p> \n<p>The main differences seems to be nature of \"pub index\". There are 3 CD servers, so we're using the pub index approach outlined in the coveo docs and the HostNameReplacerProcessor that I believe JP shared.</p> \n<p>Side note - the security provider was originally using the user \"coveo\\admin\" to authenticate, as \"sitecore\\admin\" isn't usually available in production. Even though it was a valid user in Sitecore, when I browser security permissions on that user through CES, the user has had no permissions. I've sinced changed the security provider to use \"sitecore\\admin\" and the Permissions on each source has both coveo\\admin and sitecore\\admin added. But again, only the pub database isn't working with this set up.</p> \n<p>Where can I start debugging this? What's so different about accessing the web crawler source + \"pub\"? Thanks for your help!</p>\n                </div>",
