Similarly, I don't know that I want to be adding the <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/6264/fzyyybcuvho.html\" nodeid=\"6264\">@fz</a>95xcontent parameter in code, as I imagine that value may be different through different deployment environments, and definitely would rather not explictly call the thesaurus and perform those sorts of string joins every time I run a search. For what it's worth, if I include EVERYTHING in the index, this query will return results, but as said before, I do not wish to return individual sitecore components in my search results, only the pages on which they ultimately reside.</p> \n<p>I do have the following line in my Coveo.SearchProvider.Config, but do not know what else may be needed. </p> \n<pre><code>       [ fieldType fieldName=\"_content\" isFacet=\"true\" settingType=\"Coveo.Framework.Configuration.FieldConfiguration, Coveo.Framework\" / ]\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>Thanks in advance for any help !</p>\n                </div>",
