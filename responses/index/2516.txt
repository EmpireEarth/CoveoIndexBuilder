I'm at the point of tailoring the results to suit our needs and I'm having a hard time, conceptually, drawing the line where the system reads Meta Data from the HTML crawled site (i.e. the special crawler template/layout I created) and when it goes into the Sitecore DB/Item Index and reads the Field Data.</p> \n<p>Is there an easy explanation, or am I making the mistake of naming my HTML Meta Data the same fields as my Sitecore Indexed Fields?</p> \n<p>Does one have a priority over the other? i.e. if they both share the same \"name\" the Meta Data wins over the Sitecore Indexed Field.</p> \n<p>Any and all help is appreciated.</p> \n<p>Thank you kindly, Adam</p>\n                </div>",
