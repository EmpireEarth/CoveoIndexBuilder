These fields are either single-line text or multi-line rich text.</p> \n<p>One of the pages contains (in the custom fields) a sentence which contains the words \"oil mist\". When the page is published, the custom field is added to the index with the full sentence and I can search for that page using the search term \"oil mist\" (or oil or mist), so the full-text search is working fine.</p> \n<p>However, the \"Excerpt\" for that page in the search results is empty. I would have expected that the Excerpt field would contain some snippet of text with the words \"oil mist\".</p> \n<p>PDF documents containing the words \"oil mist\" somewhere in the body of the document DO have a valid Excerpt field which shows the highlighted words.</p> \n<p>I have enabled the \"HtmlContentInBodyWithRequestsProcessor\" in the post-item processing pipeline, but the result is the same with or without that processor.</p> \n<p>Is there something special I have to do to get a valid Excerpt for pages which have custom fields?</p> \n<p>Cheers David</p>\n                </div>",
