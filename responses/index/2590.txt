Due to how facets work, we had to group items into one facet type. So we need to programmatically go through them and change the text.</p> \n<p>I am trying to find a way to grab them but any event I add seem to fire off before the facets are rendered. Would anyone know how to either override this or fire an event off after the facets load?</p> \n<p>Thanks!</p>\n                </div>",
