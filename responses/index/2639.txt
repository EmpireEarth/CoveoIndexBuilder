The Coveo diagnostics page says \"Coveo Search REST Endpoint () - The remote server returned an error: (500) Internal Server Error\" This is the only error on this page. I am able to rebuild indexes, but when I go to search in content editor I get 0 results and when I preview a Coveo search page I get the generic \"Oops! Something went wrong on the server.\" error message.</p> \n<p>My CES revision number is 7104, the revision number of the Sitecore package I installed is 742, I tried the previous solution of stopping CES, deleting the license file, restarting CES and re-indexing, and the license info listed in CES has \"SharePoint Search Interface, Default Search Interface\" listed under Available Search Interfaces, leading me to believe this is not the same error as the other day. I do not get this error when I use an instance of CES on the same server as the Sitecore instance with the same revision number.</p> \n<p>Has anyone experienced this error before?</p>\n                </div>",
