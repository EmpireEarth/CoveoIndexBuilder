I changed all the paths in Coveo.SearchProvider.config to this server's path, and when I did a new license was automatically created on the CES server, which I take to mean that the servers are communicating.</p> \n<p>We suspect that the issue has to do with SSL on the CES server. The https path in the node in Coveo.SearchProvider.config, when opened in a browser, generates a warning about the website's security certificate. Would this by itself cause the problem we are seeing? Can you confirm that this is a problem with the server, and not a problem with our config files or Coveo?</p> \n<p>Thanks</p>\n                </div>",
