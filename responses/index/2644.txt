In the other hand, I have Template called ''Program'' that has Multilist field ''Themes'' that point to ListItem Themes source. I created a new facet based on the field \"Themes\". The facet display the GUID of my Theme Items.<br>So I try to use facets based on foreign Keys. I setup Lookup field Template as \"ListItem\" and Select Field as \"Title\". as mentionned here : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SC201409/Adding+Facets+Based+on+Foreign+Keys\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SC201409/Adding+Facets+Based+on+Foreign+Keys</a> Then i added the config as mentionned here : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SC201409/Using+the+Sitecore+Search+Provider\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SC201409/Using+the+Sitecore+Search+Provider</a></p> \n<p>I would like to know : 1 - If is it required to setup manually the Foreign Key Search Provider Configuration or it should be done directly by Coveo for Sitecore ? 2- Wich Sitecore List Type the Foreign Key feature should support ? 3- Is there anything to debug or test what does not work as expected with foreign key ?</p> \n<p>I still have GUID Displayed. Thank you . </p>\n                </div>",
