The initial facet we want to display will slice the search results into groups that have different sets of facets. We'd like to let the user first choose the initial facet and then show the other facets after making a selection from the first facet. </p> \n<p>Does Coveo have support for this concept (I think the answer is not explicitly) and is there a preferred way that you would implement this requirement custom or otherwise?</p> \n<p>Thanks, </p> \n<p>Matt</p>\n                </div>",
