In CM we have coveo installed and in CD we only placed JS, Config and dll files.</p>\n<p>We are using <strong>coveo JS</strong>, indexes being maintained in <strong>Coveo Cloud</strong> and in our search results page, when we type a keyword and pass single language \"en\", results are coming fine. This is working fine in CD too. But when we add multiple languages like \"en\" and \"ja-JP\" to query builder advanced expression, results are still coming fine in CM, but in CD not able to get back response from Coveo. When we check the browser network tab, the coveo calls are continuously showing pending state. And due to this browser is getting hanged.</p>\n<p>Is this something due to configuration mismatch in CD. Please let us know your thoughts on this issue. </p>\n<p>Quick response is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
