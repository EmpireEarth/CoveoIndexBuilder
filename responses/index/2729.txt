We have separate intranet collection for each of our branches and we would like to select only one of them that belongs to the employee and exclude the other collections. I tried using query parameter 'C' , but that removes the collection from the query and user needs to open the advanced settings if they want to include other intranet collections (some users want to search on multiple intranet collections). Also this approach requires user to add the additional query parameters. If I can exclude from the collections facet, user can easily include them again without any issue.</p> \n<p>Regards</p>\n                </div>",
