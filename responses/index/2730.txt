In my scenario, I have a page that has a searchbox, several facets, and then a search button. The idea is that a user could type in a query, pick some facet values, and then hit the search that which would redirect you to the search results page with all that state applied.</p>\n<p>Building the interface without the ResultList component seems like it would be close to work, but might need tweaking and use queries needlessly. Is there a better approach? Is this just something Coveo doesn't support? </p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
