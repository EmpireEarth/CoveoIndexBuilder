I've been struggling with allowing PDFs to show up ONLY on specific sites. For instance, upload a PDF, create ONLY a UK version, and only have it show up on that site. Results have been random.<br><br>Just recently I discovered the following:<br><br>It appears that fallback versions are not playing well with Coveo, both at the item and the field level. I was having issues with the item fallback level from the beginning, so I turned on field level language fallback for the Title, Description and Keywords fields for unversioned media. I uploaded a file under English:English (our fallback language), immediately unchecked item fallback under advanced, and populated the Title, Keywords and Description field in English:English. This information showed up as expected under all other versions.<br><br>The problem, though, is that when I published and indexed, the information for Title, Keywords and Description ONLY showed up under English:English in the search index. This led to all websites showing the PDFs without any information. If you override the fallback information for those 3 fields in any language, it appears to work ok. This leads me to assume right now that the only way that Coveo is indexing/working correctly is if there are explicit versions and information for each language. Fallback (both item and field level) cannot be used.<br><br>I have yet to hear back from support on this. Any ideas?</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
