I'll number them as I come to them in my narrative...</p>\n<p>Our marketing department asked us to tune the relevance of search results so that, for instance, a search on the name of a Person would list his bio page first. Currently, there are other pages and PDFs that list first -- probably because Coveo detects that they contain more occurences of the Person's name.</p>\n<p>Using \"Boost expression rules\" looks pretty straightforward:<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Using+Boosting+or+Filtering+Rules+on+Coveo+Components\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Using+Boosting+or+Filtering+Rules+on+Coveo+Components</a></p>\n<p>So, I setup this Boost rule on the Presentation Layout Details of my search control:<br>\"where the item is the Our People item or one of its subitems<br>add 100 to document score\"</p>\n<p>(1) However, there was no effect after publishing and waiting 10+ minutes!</p>\n<p>I wondered if the \"subitems\" constraint only applied to immediate children, so I revised my rule to reference the immediate parent of Bio items:<br>\"where the item is the Bios item or one of its subitems<br>add 100 to document score\"</p>\n<p>(2) However, there was still no effect after publishing and waiting 10+ minutes!</p>\n<p>I even made sure that my browser cache, and the Sitecore cache were cleared.</p>\n<p>So then I tried to set the Boost value on the content item itself. Once I published, it worked as expected. That Person's Bio sorted first on the web site. Success!</p>\n<p>But, I need a scalable solution. So, I decided to try setting the Boost value on the Bio's Standard Values Template (SVT). The new Boost value was immediately visible for every Bio in Sitecore Content Editor, so then I published the SVT and all Bios.</p>\n<p>(3) Alas, that did not work either -- the search results showed no boosted effect... even after 10+ minutes!</p>\n<p>So then I explicitly Re-Index the Tree of Bio content (on the Developer menu).</p>\n<p>(4) That did not work either... even after 10+ minutes!</p>\n<p>Is something being cached with Coveo processes? On this page, I learned that there is something called CacheMediator. But, judging from the final answer, there is no way to manually run it.<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://answers.coveo.com/questions/7278/clearrefresh-cache-on-publish-sitecore.html\">https://answers.coveo.com/questions/7278/clearrefresh-cache-on-publish-sitecore.html</a></p>\n<p>I don't know how to troubleshoot this further.</p>\n<p>\n<p>Current Coveo for Sitecore version:4.0.895.0<br>Current Sitecore version:8.2.161221</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
