Just recently I uploaded some new PDFs that had a unique language version activated, with all other languages at 0. (i.e. PDF contains German language version, and other 5 languages are non-existent.)<br><br>Per the screen shot below, it appears that Coveo is grabbing all the unique versions, but I have yet to be able to find any of these unique PDFs in the search. I noticed that in the details of the doc in the Index Browser it shows \"Language: Unknown Language\". Is this the issue? And if so, how do I remedy it so that if I upload a PDF with only a German language version, that it will show up in only the German search results?<br><br>Note: I do have the \"Filter results on the current context language\" box checked already.<br><br>Using Coveo for Sitecore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/storage/attachments/51-capture.jpg\">capture.jpg</a></p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
