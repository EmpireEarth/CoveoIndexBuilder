The main search page had the requirement of displaying 2 sub searches as well as an entire site search.  To accomplish this I hooked 2 jQuery AJAX calls to the Coveo API in doneBuildingQueryEvent.  What is happening is that the main query for the page, and one of the two sub queries is working fine, but the last one can take a noticeable amount of time to respond, which causes the area to randomly change results as they are looking at it long after it looks like the search is complete.</p>\n<p>As a question, what is the best practice you recommend for this kind of situation where you need to make multiple calls?  Is there a prefered wait time between calling the cloud API that I could implement?</p>\n<p>A solution I can see is to hook into the queryStart, add an overlay to the page while the search is happening, and then remove it when the last query is done.  Another option is to do the first query, then do the second when the other is done, then remove the overly.</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n\n                </div>",
