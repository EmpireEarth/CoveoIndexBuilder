They are in a table report.</p> \n<p>For the case deflection successes, I have:</p> \n<pre><code> Event Value is not CaseSubmitButton or CaseSubmitAttachButton/Has Clicks is True/and the Origin\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>The other table has (meaning it has failed):</p> \n<pre><code> Event Value is CaseSubmitButton or CaseSubmitAttachButton/Has Clicks is True/and the Origin\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>The issue is that there is no way that Coveo categorizes each event as a separate value so if a user searches, for example: \"Print Error\" and clicks on a doc, it is considered a success but if later on, during the same session, they open a case, it is considered a fail.</p> \n<p>If I want to show which document did in fact lead to a deflection and which doc did not in a session, how could this be done in a Coveo report? Not a visit card but showing actual actionable data?</p>\n                </div>",
