The category page should be higher in the results (either first or within top 10 hits). In other words instead of the suggestion \"category\" selected interpreted as a searched keyword, the search page should show the \"category\" filter pre-selected from the facets and show the results.</p> \n<p>3- If there is only single result hit meaning if the query suggestions just shows a single item from the \"Title\" group, it should directly take the user to the detail page and not the search result page. It is as if the user clicked on a result item in the search results page.</p>\n                </div>",
