      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>Hello all,</p> \n<p>In our environment, we have roughly 62 articles that are marked internal only within Salesforce but are still showing up on our website when searched by an anonymous public user without a login to our site. We have thousands of articles within the same repository that are marked the same way that work as expected. I know standard practice of Coveo is to not even display the article when marked internal only. The user can click on the article which then re-directs them to to login page which is good, but they should not even be able to see the article in the first place. I am new to Coveo and this is a task I was handed to figure out and would love some feedback on where to begin to resolve this issue. This question may be kind of vague and broad but any help would be appreciated.</p> \n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n                </div>",
