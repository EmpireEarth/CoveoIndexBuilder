I see that the AD conenctor existed in previous versions of Coveo, but I'm not seeing it in the list of available connectors when configuring content source settings.</p> \n<p>Would this require a custom connector, or is the AD connector going to be available with a fully licensed install of Coveo for Sitecore?</p> \n<p>Thanks</p>\n                </div>",
