They have sporadic user feedback that queries can be slow (2-5 seconds) and I've looked at the analytics to see some rare spikes for individual users up to 15+ seconds. Are there any specific troubleshooting things they should be looking at? </p> \n<p>Would a timeline recording in DevTools from the browser be useful? When they looked at this they see a script called CoveoJsSearch.js1 which takes 562.37 ms. </p>\n                </div>",
