      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>Hi</p> \n<p>I am trying to index documents with the HTML Content Processor. For this I have followed this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Indexing+Documents+with+HTML+Content+Processor\">guide</a> and added a Quick View Device and created a new Quick View Layout where I have removed content such as navigation, footer and other search-irrelevant stuff. I only want the content of the page to be rendered, so its content can be indexed. </p> \n<p>The website is meant to be used with the Experience Editor which means we use a lot of components. Each page only consist of the fields Title, Short-intro and Main-textarea - all other content are added as components via view renderings. The content added via the Experience Editor is shown as controls under Presentation -> Details -> Standard. My initial thought was that in order for my new Quick View Device to render the content inserted via the Experience Edtior, the same controls should appear under the Quick View Device. See example of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.screencast.com/t/OK1rRrG2yfT\">Details</a>. Currently the Quick Device View is obviously blank as there are no controls to render content. </p> \n<p>How can I create a binding between the Standard Device and the Quick Device, so that the content inserted via the Experience Editor also is what Coveo will index when using the Quick View Device? </p>\n                </div>",
