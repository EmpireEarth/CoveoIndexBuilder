We are using CFS Sep'16 for CES 3.0 and we noticed that the \"subject\" field (@fsubject####) does not seem to get updated after first indexing. You see we have some media items with some text in them (in the pdf content) that we have already removed in the updated content, but Coveo still has that text in the \"subject\" field even though that particular text does not exist anymore anywhere in the document. We tried full re-indexing republish etc, but the text remains in the subject field. </p> \n<p>Any ideas?</p> \n<p>Thanks Dean</p>\n                </div>",
