After upgrading to the latest version of Coveo (Dec 2016), we have issues connecting to the Coveo rest api from bindings which name is not the same of the iis site name.</p> \n<p>I went through the process of creating the self signed certificate for the main site and it went well but you cannot add different certificates to each binding in IIS. This happens in our local environments. Is there any way to bypass this security check?</p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p> IIS site name: coveosite </p> </li> \n <li><p> Bindings: - coveosite port 443 - coveositefrench port 443</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Both uses the same SSL certificate created for coveosite. coveosite works OK. coveositefrench cannot connecto to coveo rest api due to issues with the SSL certificate and its validation.</p> \n<p>Let me know if the point is clear.</p>\n                </div>",
