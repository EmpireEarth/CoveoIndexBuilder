Like any settings that we can utilize, etc.,</p> \n<p>So, as I understand every time a publish happens indexes are updated. So, right after publish I go to the web page where we have Coveo renderings, I see that the data is not loading/partial for few seconds. After few seconds, it is all good. </p> \n<p>Though we typically recommend our clients to do publish only in the down time. We all know they will not listen and would use Sitecore workflow to push some items live in the day time. </p> \n<p>How can we avoid this delay? And is this normal or we need to look at some of our settings. </p>\n                </div>",
