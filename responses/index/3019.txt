Only one Sitecore site has the index sources created successfully; while the other do not have any when checking the CES admin web tool.</p> \n<p>I'm not sure when the Coveo index source is created during the installation. My assumption is that they are created during the package installation for \"Coveo for Sitecore\". </p> \n<p>I was trying to following the following instructions to manually create a source, but the Sitecore is not listed in the source type <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://onlinehelp.coveo.com/en/ces/7.0/administrator/configuring_and_indexing_a_sitecore_source.htm\">https://onlinehelp.coveo.com/en/ces/7.0/administrator/configuring_and_indexing_a_sitecore_source.htm</a></p> \n<p>We are using a paid license \"Coveo for Sitecore V4 Pro on Premise\" and use the cloud platform (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://platform.cloud.coveo.com\">https://platform.cloud.coveo.com</a>) to connect the site to the license. Coveo told us the license file is no longer be used.</p> \n<p>Without the source, the index cannot be built. Is there other way we can manually create the index? </p> \n<p>I've also reinstalled the Coveo for Sitecore package but the installation wizard no longer show up. Should I recreate the whole Sitecore instance and start all over? </p>\n                </div>",
