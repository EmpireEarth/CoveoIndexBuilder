As far as I can tell that should be setup and running on their environment. It also doesn't seem to be running on save when using the Master index. Looking through the logs I don't see any errors, it just doesn't seem to update in the index.</p> \n<p>Any ideas on where I can look would be helpful.</p> \n<p>Thanks</p>\n                </div>",
