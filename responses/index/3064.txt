Inside of deferredQuerySuccess, we are looking for class: .coveo-selected through DOM, and manipulate it. However, if we get no results, inside noResults we set args.retryTheQuery = true. So, this time inside deferredQuerySuccess there is no coveo-selected class, but it is being added later.</p> \n<p>Can you tell us how to get a trigger after class coveo-selected was already added.</p> \n<p>Thank you very much!</p>\n                </div>",
