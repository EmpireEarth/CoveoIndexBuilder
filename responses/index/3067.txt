      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>Hello,</p> \n<p>I am working on an upgrade from Coveo for Sitecore 4.0 July 2016 to the latest version of December 2016. I was able to execute the diagnostic page and got all greens and I am also able to fully rebuild all indexes. </p> \n<p>Now, I need to focus on a number of JS Components that we customized and that now are throwing errors. I know that between these versions the Coveo JS Framework was changed but I am not sure on how to proceed migrating the components we already have working in PROD.</p> \n<p>For example, we have a component that we drop in the html and automatically adds a filter to the search:</p> \n<p> </p>\n \n\n<p> \n<p>Then, the constructor:</p> \n<pre><code>  function ColumnFilter(element, options, bindings) {\n         _super.call(this, element, ColumnFilter.ID, bindings);\n \n         this.options = Coveo.ComponentOptions.initComponentOptions(element, ColumnFilter, options);\n \n         this.bind.onRoot(Coveo.QueryEvents.buildingQuery, this.buildingQuery.bind(this));\n     }\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>I am getting an error on the last line, saying that <em>onRoot is not a function</em>. </p> \n<pre><code> Uncaught TypeError: this.bind.onRoot is not a function\n     at new ColumnFilter (column-filter.js:12)\n     at Function.t.createComponentOfThisClassOnElement (Initialization.ts:285)\n     at Initialization.ts:496\n     at Function.M.each.M.forEach (underscore-min.js:5)\n     at Initialization.ts:483\n     at Initialization.ts:255\n     at Function.M.each.M.forEach (underscore-min.js:5)\n     at Function.t.automaticallyCreateComponentsInside (Initialization.ts:255)\n     at Function.t.initSearchInterface (Initialization.ts:170)\n     at RegisteredNamedMethods.ts:26\n \n\n</code></pre> \n<p>Do we have a migration guide for these components? How can I realize how to bind stuff with this latest version. Any idea that can lead me in the right direction, would be appreciated.</p> \n<p>By the way, I downloaded and mount the search-ui branch from npm and looks like all components are done with Typescript. We would like to avoid having to rewrite all our features.</p> \n<p>Thanks! </p>\n                </div>",
