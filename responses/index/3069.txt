No search is possible until the service has been restarted. What can we check to troubleshoot where the issue may be coming from? Do we have any reports to see if we are reaching the limits? like number of search per second or anything that could point us to where the issue is? RabbitMQ seem to be normal and no disk space issues are there in the server. </p> \n<p>Thanks</p>\n                </div>",
