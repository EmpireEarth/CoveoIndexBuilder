This is Coveo Cloud and it's a Sitecore 8.1 instance.</p> \n<p>The original site was working OK with the module and while I executed a diagnostic it showed all greens. After upgrading, this diagnostic page is showing the error in the title. There had been no changes to the domain nor certificate as it was OK in the previous version.</p> \n<p><em>The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. Search for information on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://search.coveo.com\">search.coveo.com</a> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. ---> System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.</em></p> \n<p>More useful data is that while indexing content seems to be pushed to the cloud but the reindexing process always ends up with the already mentioned error, as well.</p> \n<p>Can you provide some help troubleshooting this? I need to be 100% OK in my local prior to push to UAT and PROD.</p> \n<p>Regards,</p>\n                </div>",
