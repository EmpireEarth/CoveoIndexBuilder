We suspect this is due to the native search being able to show said content to anonymous users through the community's guest user profile.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the end-goal would be to show selected objects from Secured sources to anonymous users in a first step, and then to respect the permissions as usual once users are logged in.</p> \n<p>Use of the Anonymous Profile as per <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://onlinehelp.coveo.com/en/cloud/configuring_coveo_for_salesforce_v2.htm\">https://onlinehelp.coveo.com/en/cloud/configuring_coveo_for_salesforce_v2.htm</a> does not appear to be giving out the desired result.</p> \n<p>One idea would consequently be to identify the community's guest user's email and to inject the latter in the access token via userIds as per <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SearchREST/Search+Token+Authentication.\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SearchREST/Search+Token+Authentication.</a> Obviously, one would need to ensure that the objects in question are visible to the guest user profile, on Salesforce's side.</p> \n<p>Essentially: <br> 1) Would you have a better recommendation? <br> 2) Did we miss an easy out-the-box way to achieve this goal?</p> \n<p>We'd certainly have follow-ups, but let's start form the above foundation.</p>\n                </div>",
