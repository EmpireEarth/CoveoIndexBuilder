We can see the Quick View with all of the content and can highlight the text we are searching for but again cannot search for those words. We can also search for the words directly in the PDF so I know that it is not just images.</p> \n<p>What would cause this type of issue? I also tried the LibreOffice and pdf2html but I am still getting the same results.</p> \n<p>Our goal is to search through these large pdf's (and spreadsheets) and perhaps use the Quick View so they can see the results of the search (each PDF is a collection of letters sent to people)</p>\n                </div>",
