Now, this sitecore instance is behind a AD authentication which means for CES and Search API to be able to communicate with the Sitecore Instance on which Coveo for Sitecore is installed, It should be passing in a set of credentials along with standard settings of Security Provider Coveo add's by default on to CES configuration tool. I did see some documentation out there, but, I am unsure which settings would actually pass this credentials along to Sitecore URL to have successful communication. Do I need to do any specific steps here? </p>\n                </div>",
