We're trying to reduce the number of clicks our users have to make in order to get the information they need as quickly as possible. We have a SharePoint list filled with FAQs, and some of those contain links to supporting documentation. The hyperlinks work properly in the list itself, and in each item that contains a link. However, I noticed that when you search for the items in Coveo that the link in the description is only text. You have to open up the item in order to click on the link contained within it's fields. </p> \n<p>This also seems to be true of really any document. If a Word document has a hyperlink inside of it, that link won't be usable from the search results. You have to open the document, because in the search results it appears as just plain text.</p> \n<p>Is there anyway to make a hyperlink that shows up in a search result description usable from the search result page?</p> \n<p>Any information on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!</p>\n                </div>",
