      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>Hello,</p> \n<p>I know that Coveo uses a Title Selection Sequence to try to determine the title of PDF documents. For some of our PDF documents the file name is used for the title. I want to change this to something more meaningful. First I tried setting the \"Title\" of the PDF item (the Data Template for PDFs in Sitecore has a Title field). I also tried creating a Post Item Processor to set the \"args.CoveoItem.Title\". Neither of these approaches worked.</p> \n<p>From what I can tell, if I was to change the Title Selection Sequence as specified <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://answers.coveo.com/questions/4329/index-item-and-associated-media-item\">here</a>, I may be able to get this to work. The problem is, I can't find where to set the title selection sequence. I am using the \"SitecoreCloudTrialEdition\" and am on version 4.0.450. From what I have heard, this version does not support changing the Title Selection Sequence.</p> \n<p>I know I can create an alternate field to store a \"title\", but we would like the benefit of setting the official title so it will have a higher weighting.</p> \n<p>Is there a way to override the Title for PDF documents?</p> \n<p>Thanks, Mike</p>\n                </div>",
