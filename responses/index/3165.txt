I know Coveo for Sitecore comes with pre-baked renderings that wrap the existing JS framework components, but some of the features in those are only available via the enterprise edition (like the rules based filtering). And on top of that, often times my projects have unique features or designs for components like facets and such, or components that just don't exist in the current Coveo JS feature set. My go-to answer has been to use the JS framework to build either completely custom components or augment/modify/inherit existing components to add functionality. Does Coveo offer any recommendations on what to do or not do when it comes to stuff like this? Is there any documentation around the JS specific to Coveo for Sitecore or is that considered \"off-limits\" to custom dev?</p>\n                </div>",
