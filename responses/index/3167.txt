We have tabbed components on our coveo rendering and on one tab, I display results of certain template only and I will need the above computed multi field, but, on other tab(different template), I would need a sitecore field(traditional droplist select). </p> \n<p>I see a note on facet(under buckets), that, I can enter multiple fields with a comma. But, when I try to combine above computed multi field and regular sitecore field in the \"field name\", I can not make it to work. </p> \n<p>Is this even possible to combine these kind of fields on a facet? If not, what are my options here? I basically need one facet that would cover both my Multi Value Computed field and regular sitecore drop list select field. </p>\n                </div>",
