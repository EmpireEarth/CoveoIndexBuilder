But the installer stops midway and rollbacks all the changes. I get this message, </p> \n<p>\"Setup was interrupted before Coveo EnterPrise Search could be completely installed.\"</p> \n<p>Is this happening because I had earlier installed the higher version and my system still has some of its references? Any help is appreciated.</p>\n                </div>",
