Does Coveo support this functionality?</p> \n<p>I was also thinking I could duplicate the item for each location and then have Coveo filter out duplicates only based on the item's name for instance. I know Coveo supports filtering duplicates but can we specify which fields it uses to figure out if an item is a duplicate?</p>\n                </div>",
