They are using Coveo Cloud edition for their customer-facing indexes. In the event of a failover to the disaster recovery environment, what changes would be necessary to sync the Coveo Cloud indexes to this DR scenario? Since they will replicate their SQL Server databases and implementation code, the DR environment should be a good replica of their production environment and I donâ\x80\x99t think any special measures are required for Coveo Cloud in terms of returning query results. I want to confirm that with you.</p> \n<p>Also, in terms of document ingestion, is there any machine key or other identification Coveo Cloud includes in the service request? Assuming the Coveo license holder uses the same Coveo license key, would there be any reason the DR environment couldnâ\x80\x99t send Coveo Cloud index updates?</p> \n<p>I think Coveo Cloud makes this very easy, but I want to check with you to be sure.</p>\n                </div>",
