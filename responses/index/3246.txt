Eg. \"myfield\" = \"fmyfield1234\"</p> \n<p>We found the utility function that does the conversion works but for some reason was nonperformant and since we were converting the same field names every time we just cached the first result. </p> \n<p>The problem though is it seems like sometimes those hashes change, or otherwise don't match the field names in the source we want to hit? For example, we might have cached <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5508/fmarkovic.html\" nodeid=\"5508\">@fm</a>yfield1234 but we see the field missing, we go look at the index and see it's <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/6584/myfilmbop.html\" nodeid=\"6584\">@myfi</a>eld4567 or something. We suspect someone did an index rebuild or something that reset that hash, but we're not sure. It seems like if we bounce IIS (our application is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://mvc.net\">mvc.net</a>) to clear our cache, everything is fine (for a while....).</p> \n<p>Can you tell us: a) does the suffix hash # ever change? we thought maybe sometimes doing an index rebuild via the sitecore interface or something can occasionally change that #? b) does this sound like a familiar cm/cd issue? how can we assure that multiple coveo indexes share the same suffix? c) recommended or not, can we turn the suffixing off altogether? d) is there some method call to determine the suffix programatically?</p> \n<p>thanks.</p>\n                </div>",
