The sort works when sorting on just the date field, but does not additionally sort on the distance field. If I remove the date field and sort only on the distance field, the distance sort works. If I add any other field in addition to distance, the distance sort does not work. Is this intended behavior?</p> \n<p>Thanks in advance, Nick</p>\n                </div>",
