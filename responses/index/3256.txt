For example, we have a Sitecore field called \"Meta Description\". In it, we've put a string with some test data. When doing a site search using the Coveo Search Box, the results of the Search View don't show the item. However, putting the same text into a different field (like Meta Title), will allow the text to be searched for.</p> \n<p>I've looked in the CES Admin and the appropriate text is making it there. The appropriate check boxes in the field configuration in CES Admin seems right, too. Some fields just aren't being searched.</p> \n<p>Any ideas on why this might be?</p>\n                </div>",
