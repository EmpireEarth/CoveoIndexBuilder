However, throughout our application we use a template with a \"Title\" field, and would prefer <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5123/systelab.html\" nodeid=\"5123\">@syst</a>itle map to this. The reason is our Title field contains \"uncleansed\" characters that sitecore strips out when it creates the Item.Name property. Also, we have external data sources for which we have code already using the <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5123/systelab.html\" nodeid=\"5123\">@syst</a>itle field, although the source may not have its own \"title\" field. We're trying to unite the \"title\" concept across our sources and <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5123/systelab.html\" nodeid=\"5123\">@syst</a>itle field seemed like the way to go, except it isn't aligned with our true \"title\" concept in Sitecore. a. Is there a simple config setting we can change to do this, i.e. point <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5123/systelab.html\" nodeid=\"5123\">@syst</a>itle to our Item.Fields[\"Title\"] instead of Item.Name? b. Or could we cause <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5123/systelab.html\" nodeid=\"5123\">@syst</a>itle to be a computed field where we could force it to fall back to Item.Name only if \"Title\" isn't available for the item? c. Is it possible to use aliases per source? E.g. our sitecore source alias \"Title\" to \"Title\" but all our other sources alias \"Title\" to <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5123/systelab.html\" nodeid=\"5123\">@syst</a>itle? </p> </li> \n <li><p> We need to be able to sort and startswith <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5123/systelab.html\" nodeid=\"5123\">@syst</a>itle. a. Is turning it into a facet field only possible with the admin gui, or is there a way to do it in the config file as with e.g. our computed fields or non-system fields? We try but it doesn't seem to take.</p> </li> \n</ol>\n                </div>",
