However I am able to browse the url on server without any issue. Security provider is working only if I provide \"server host name\" instead of \"Domain name\" . Do we have to always provide only \"Machine name\" or IP address. Can't we provide DNS name in serverUrl? </p> \n<p>Note : Our sitecore site has Authentication pipeline which will verify against AD. We do have created one AD user for Coveo and CES is running with that user account. will coveo security provider connects with sitecore from internal network by providing network credentials? I am suspecting this as I am able to browse the url on server in browser however it is unable connect in CES.</p>\n                </div>",
