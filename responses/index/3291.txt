This component is a video library category list. so each video will be tagged with a category and I want to be able to add using this component an instance for each category on the search results page. Since the categories are facets I will be able to search through the facets. \nI have read this link\n<a href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/JsSearchV1/Implementing+a+Custom+Component\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/JsSearchV1/Implementing+a+Custom+Component</a></p>\n<p>but in my case I have a ordened list where I need to be able to render video title, description, etc. an d I'm not really sure how I will build this. In this link there is an example for a searchbox.\nHave anyone done anything like this or know how to build an ordened list with multiple information I need to render coming from the search results?</p>\n<p>thanks</p>\n\n                </div>",
