Because it isn't all uniform, we have users entering different formats of the same title. For instance one might enter PhD and another, Ph.D. </p> \n<p>Since these titles are among the fields that are searchable, and so, we'd like to ensure that when a person searches for PhD we also return Ph.D. etc. I could normalize them at index time and store/display them uniformly, but is there a way that this can be done at search time as well? </p> \n<p>The problem isn't restricted to just PhD. Other examples in use are MS/M.S., MD/M.D., MPharm/M.Pharm. etc. </p> \n<p>Any suggestions/tips/tricks? </p>\n                </div>",
