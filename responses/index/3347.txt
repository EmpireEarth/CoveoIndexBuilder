      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>The bellow scenario is using the REST Search API directly, not using the JavaScript UI</p>\n<p>We have the parent concept of an Article, with zero or more child Attachments.</p>\n<p>We have used the approach below, with the following field names in accordance to this <a href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/SearchREST/Query+Parameter\">help page</a>:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><p> <strong>parentField</strong>: \"@computedfoldingchildren\", (Articles have this field, it is a multivalue field of the sitecore guids of each child Attachment. Attachments do not have this field at all).\n</p>\n\n  </li>\n  <li><p> <strong>childField</strong>: \"@computedfoldingprimaryid\", (Both Articles and Attachments have this field, it is simply the sitecore guid)\n</p>\n\n  </li>\n  <li><p> <strong>filterField</strong>: \"@computedfoldingid\", (Both Articles and Attachments have this, for an Article it is its own sitecore guid, for an Attachment it is its parent Articleâ\x80\x99s sitecore guid)</p>\n\n  </li>\n\n </ul>\n<p>It seems to be working in my poc, though my result object is shaped slightly different than how I was expecting. It seems like I get one result per â\x80\x9cgroupâ\x80\x9d.  Unless the parent Article is the outer â\x80\x9chitâ\x80\x9d, it is  loaded as the .parentResult, with children loaded as .childResults. This is not ideal but should work for us.</p>\n<p>The issue we now face is with facets. To oversimplify, Articles have metadata we facet on, letâ\x80\x99s simplify it down to â\x80\x9cGeographyâ\x80\x9d. Attachments typically donâ\x80\x99t have geography explicitly, but would inherit the concept from the parent. So I went ahead and added geography as a computed field to the Attachments (derived from the parent during the crawl). (This also allows us to do field level filtering, i.e. <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/6156/georgeagili.html\" nodeid=\"6156\">@geo</a>graphy=Canadaâ\x80¦which unless Iâ\x80\x99m mistaken we need to have on the Attachments otherwise it will fail?)</p>\n<p>But the problem I have is if I groupBy facet on <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/6156/georgeagili.html\" nodeid=\"6156\">@geo</a>graphy, Iâ\x80\x99d like to have each â\x80\x9cgroupâ\x80\x9d (a â\x80\x9cgroupâ\x80\x9d being Article and its Attachments) count only once. Say for example q: is â\x80\x9cDogâ\x80\x9d. I have an Article that does not contain â\x80\x9cDogâ\x80\x9d at all, but it has 3 Attachments, only two of which contains â\x80\x9cDogâ\x80\x9d. Letâ\x80\x99s say the Articleâ\x80\x99s <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/6156/georgeagili.html\" nodeid=\"6156\">@geo</a>graphy is Canada. Iâ\x80\x99d like the facet for Canada to be 1, despite the article itself not having â\x80\x9cdogâ\x80\x9d, and 2 of the attachments hitting (and having their parent Articleâ\x80\x99s inherited Geography as Canada). Right now I seem to be getting 2 as the count in the groupby. Similarly if say the Article and and 1 of the 3 attachments has â\x80\x9cdogâ\x80\x9d, I get 2.  </p>\n<p>I tried for example playing with queryOverride on the groupBy clause, but a) it doesnâ\x80\x99t seem to have an effect (maybe not on our version of Coveo?) and b) not sure it is the right approach for this.</p>\n<p>Just to clarify above, as I know folding is commonly used for email threads, my analogy would be that we have a thread weâ\x80\x99ve constructed consisting of any emails in the thread that satisfy the query filters, plus the original email in the thread whether it satisfies the filters or not.  We know that every email in the thread has the same field <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/6156/georgeagili.html\" nodeid=\"6156\">@geo</a>graphy=Canada as metada, but when we facet we want the entire thread to only count once for the count of Canada.</p>\n\n                </div>",
