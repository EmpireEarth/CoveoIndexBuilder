If a user searches for \"App\", wildcard search enables us to get results back for both indexed items. However, if a user searches for \"Appla\", we get no results back and the queryCorrections array is empty. </p> \n<p>A couple of things to note:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p> An asterisk * is appended to every search query, so \"Appla\", is really \"Appla*\" (which causes the problem) </p> </li> \n <li><p> We want all indexed fields to be searched against </p> </li> \n <li><p> We are directly interfacing with the REST API (we plan on migrating to the Coveo Javascript framework when we get a better understanding of it). </p> </li> \n <li><p> The searches are performed as follows: [API_URI]/rest/search?q=[QUERY]*&wildcards=true&enableDidYouMean=true</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Our goal is for \"App*\" to return suggestions back (which it is currently doing) as well as \"Appla*\" to return corrections.</p>\n                </div>",
