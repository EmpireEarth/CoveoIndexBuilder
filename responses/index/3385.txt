We also have certain pages that list all of a certain type of page (for example, news articles), by way of a search view. These listings just show the most recent results with no way to filter with a search term, so there's no search field provided. In other words, their functionality is entirely separate from the search box.</p> \n<p>The problem is that when I put this search view onto a page which already has a search box (which means, pretty much any page), the search view is not shown. The mark up is there, no errors appear to be thrown, it just doesn't show up.</p> \n<p>I've tried filling in the id on the search box, but didn't find a similar field on the search view. I had hoped filling these in would show they aren't related, but that didn't fix the issue.</p> \n<p>Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>\n                </div>",
