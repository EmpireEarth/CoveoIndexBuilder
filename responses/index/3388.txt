      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>Based on the documentation, it looks like the Coveo JS Framework supports GroupBy queries. My question is how do I actually implement the display of the results. We are in the processing of converting from Lucene to Coveo and we have a page that currently renders results of a particular type grouped by the date. We have events that occur on a given date and we show the date then all of the events for that date are shown beneath. In <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://answers.coveo.com/questions/5907/is-groupby-functionality-out-of-the-box-coveo-for-sitecore-\">this</a> forum post, the suggestion is to use folding to represent the parent child relationship. In my example, there is not parent/child, just a true groupBy. Is there someway I can use ResultsList to render the groups or do I not need groupBy at all and just use folding on my results? Any help would be appreciated.</p> \n<p>Thanks in advance, Nick</p>\n                </div>",
