On one of my clients we have a scenario where the Sitecore's content management server is the same server that runs coveo. This client's website has an scaled environment running with 2 cd nodes with mirrors.\nThey want to do some maintenance on the content management server and want to know if and how it impacts Coveo.\nThey would be ok with a content freeze which means no indexing happening. In this scenario is it possible to have the search working only against the mirrors?\nI would say no but I am not 100% sure</p>\n<p>thanks</p>\n\n                </div>",
