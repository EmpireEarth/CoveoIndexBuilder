This confused me.... How does it know to search the external source then?</p>\n<p><strong>Lastly:-</strong>\n<strong>Using POCOs and performing a query</strong>\nThe above code uses a custom POCO 'CustomSearchItem'. I found I had the same issue as the question poster, where I wasn't retrieving any results.\nHowever, when I just used SearchResultItem, and used CoveoWhere(\"some query text\"), I would get results.</p>\n<p>How can I query, say, on just the '@customtitle' field?\nAnd if I had a POCO with CustomTitle as a property, what attributes do I need on it, and how could it be used in a query like the one above?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n                </div>",
