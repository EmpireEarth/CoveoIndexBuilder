When I receive the results back I am getting items that contain the word \"library\" ranked higher than words with the search term, \"computer\", due to term weights being applied based on the filters for the full path.</p> \n<p>Why are the strings that I am using as advanced query facet filters being applied as general term weights? Is there something I can do to stop this behavior? I would expect that the terms that are specified as the filters would not be weighted as general terms when searching.</p>\n                </div>",
