It was working at first but I left editing that page and started working on other pages then I came back and nothing would show up on the page. I see the Coveo loading image when the page is loading, I see the divs that should be getting populated, and I even see the call being made successfully to the rest services, but nothing actually gets rendered on the page in editor or preview mode. Does anybody have an idea how I could debug this? I have checked the javascript console and there are no errors and I've tried manually calling init() through the console but still nothing happens.</p> \n<p>Thanks, John</p>\n                </div>",
