I want to filter my content by the last ones updated so I'm using this.</p>\n<p>When I tried to set the field on the search page as I was adding a new facet view it wouldn't show up on the field dropdown. I did notice that only some of the items that were on that list were showing on the drop-down. So I started to compare the ones that are showing and the ones that are.\nThe Date Range shows for example. So what I did as a troubleshooting technic was setting on the Date Range the field updated and after that when I go back to the search page and try to select the Date Range from the dropdown it is not anymore. If I restore the daterange value to the field it shows. </p>\n<p>Any ideas why my field won't work and it won't show on the dropdown?\nI also edited as I was troubleshooting the excludedfields section which the updated field is set there and I commented to see if that would do any good but that was not the case.</p>\n<p>any ideas is highly appreciated\nthanks</p>\n\n                </div>",
