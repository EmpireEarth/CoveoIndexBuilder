      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>Hi</p> \n<p>Im trying to install CES 7.0 x64 (8225) for Sitecore on Windows Server 2012 R2 using a local admin account. The wizard asks for the service account creds and I enter the user, pwl and enter the computer name in the domain. After this the wizard begins the install process. By this point, i see an event log entry that the acct was successfully logged in. After Coveo installs the services and tries starting them, there's some failure and everything is rolled back. in the event logs I see the following entry</p> \n<pre><code> > The CES7_x64 service was unable to log\n > on as .\\coveo_svc with the currently\n > configured password due to the\n > following error:  The user name or\n > password is incorrect.\n > \n > To ensure that the service is\n > configured properly, use the Services\n > snap-in in Microsoft Management\n > Console (MMC).\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>I see that it's complaining about the creds but like i said earlier I see entries that it had successfully logged in the user. LIke this one:</p> \n<pre><code> An account was successfully logged on.\n \n Subject:\n     Security ID:        SYSTEM\n     Account Name:        QA$\n     Account Domain:        WORKGROUP\n     Logon ID:        0x3E7\n \n Logon Type:            5\n \n Impersonation Level:        Impersonation\n \n New Logon:\n     Security ID:        QA\\coveo_svc\n     Account Name:        coveo_svc\n     Account Domain:        QA\n     Logon ID:        0x32F7DE\n     Logon GUID:        {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\n \n Process Information:\n     Process ID:        0x244\n     Process Name:        C:\\Windows\\System32\\services.exe\n \n Network Information:\n     Workstation Name:    QA\n     Source Network Address:    -\n     Source Port:        -\n \n Detailed Authentication Information:\n     Logon Process:        Advapi  \n     Authentication Package:    Negotiate\n     Transited Services:    -\n     Package Name (NTLM only):    -\n     Key Length:        0\n \n This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.\n\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>This VM is a standalone and is not part of a domain. This had never been an issue before, so can you please confirm that this hasnt changed?</p> \n<p>Also worth mentioning, the service account is member of Admins and Users groups. And I also granted it log-on-as-service rights. I validated this by setting coveo_svc on one of the windows services and was able to start it successfully. </p> \n<p>UPDATE 1: I enabled the windows installer logging and i couldnt identity anything.
