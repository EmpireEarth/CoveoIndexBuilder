We are currently running in to 2 issues that i dont fully understand.</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p> Does anything need to be installed on the SharePoint side if we do not have a search UI within SharePoint. It looks like based on the documentation the answer is no but it wasn't clear how the connector crawls SharePoint. Is the connect using the SharePoint Web API?</p> </li> \n <li><p> Since Sitecore users will be searching the SharePoint index, security may be an issue. Everything in the SharePoint index will be available to any Sitecore user. Would we just need to set something up with impersonation to make sure the Sitecore user will be able to access the SharePoint index?</p> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>Thanks, Rob</p>\n                </div>",
