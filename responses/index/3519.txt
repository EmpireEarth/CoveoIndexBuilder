I am now facing a whole number of very frustrating errors.</p> \n<p>Background: I encountered some server errors and was forced to upgrade to a new version (8225 instead of 7711 running on my other servers.) I was still getting a number of errors so I uninstalled the whole backend/admin section, reinstalled 5425 and then ran the install up to 8225 (the upgrade to 7711 reported that there was a windows error with no target for the upgrade so I had to skip that one and go all the way to 8225.) It ran fine, but when I try to start my Sitecore index I am getting the following errors:</p> \n<p>Invalid Crawler ID: CESCC.DotNetCrawler#Sitecore2. class Merlin::CustomCrawlerNotFoundException: class CustomCrawlers::CrawlerNotFoundException: The custom crawler \"CESCC.DotNetCrawler.7\" was not found.</p> \n<p>I have inspected the connectors configuration and everything seems to be right (what had been called Sitecore2 is now just called Sitecore, but the index settings seemed to have picked up this change without problems.)</p> \n<p>Does anyone know what happened here? I have done extensive searching and can't even find a reference to this error anywhere.</p>\n                </div>",
