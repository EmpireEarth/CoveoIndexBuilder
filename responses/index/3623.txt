In reality, all sources should be tagged with product, but they are not.</p> \n<p>Our current search displays the sources facet, the product facet and the OS facet. The issue that I have is that when users search they have no idea which sources map to which taxonomies. As some sources have no tags from certain taxonomies(even though they should), those sources are wrongly excluded (dissappear).</p> \n<p>I realize that this is an issue with our source data, not Coveo, but fixing our source data is difficult. </p> \n<p>I'm wondering if anyone else has seen similar problems and how they approached fixing them. We have mapped the product and OS taxonomies, but I haven't seen a way to leverage those. e.g. when OS \"y\" is selected from OS facet also select product segment \"x\" from the product facet and vise-a-versa. Alternatively, would be possible to address this when crawling (i.e. add the other tags as the data comes in.)</p> \n<p>Finally, I'm wondering if a taxonomy management system would help. They seem to have good features, but it's unclear how the data would be used to Coveo. I think we would still have to tag the source data.</p>\n                </div>",
