This is causing issues when that role is removed from the item but the user is still left, granting the permission set the role was given.</p> \n<p>From within sitecore, the extranet/anonymous role is denied read access to an item and then the role extranet/partner is assigned read access. The item is published and it acts as expected. However, when I look at the effective permissions of the indexed item both the role and the user have been given access to the item. Not an issue at this point.</p> \n<p>During testing the extranet/partner role is removed from the security applied to the item leaving only extranet/anonymous being denied read access as the security settings on the item. The item is published and... I can still see the item being returned. When I look at the indexed items effective permissions now the extranet/partner role is removed as expected but the user that was in that role is still given access to the item.</p> \n<p>I have waited for the index update transaction to be committed and have run both Update Cache Now and Clear External Security Cache Now commands in Security Cache section.</p> \n<p>Is this the expected behaviour?</p>\n                </div>",
