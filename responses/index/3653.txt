It does not appear that the problem existed last week.</p>\n<p>In the test environment when we select \"All Content\" there are 1,056,754 results returned. \"All Content\" is a combination of several sources.</p>\n<p>When I sort by date, it only sorts the first 20 results instead of sorting by date on all the results. The most recent result, after sorting,  is dated 2/13/2014 even though there are many results with a more current date.</p>\n<p>If I select one of the other tabs (CSList which is a Web Crawler source), I get the same results. However, if I select one of the facets (sbc5x00), it filters for 'sbc5x00' results and the most recent result is from yesterday.</p>\n<p>But if I select two facets (sbc5x00 and insight), I then get the same results as I did when selecting the \"All Content\" tab.  It just happens that 'insight' results (HTML files) are the the most recently dated files on the CSList Web source based upon the script that created them. This script generates the files for the CSList source and runs nightly. But if I \"touch\" another set of HTML files (sessionmgr_and_apps), rebuild the source and then issue another query, then the sessionmgr_and_apps results appear as the most recent results even though they were actually created in 2012.  The displayed date for these results, however,  comes from a generated field, cslistdate, and is correct.</p>\n<p>Shouldn't the CoveoSort class sort all results, not just the set of results displayed on a page ?\n </p>\n\n                </div>",
