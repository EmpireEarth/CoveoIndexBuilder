The main search results page lives under site 'SharedSite'. On many pages in sites 'MySite1' and 'MySite2', I've added a Global Searchbox as described by the following developers page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SC201410/Create+a+Global+Searchbox+for+Your+Site\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SC201410/Create+a+Global+Searchbox+for+Your+Site</a></p> \n<p>I have indexed data from all of the sites in my Sitecore instance and all data has a calculated field which indicates from which site the content was indexed: <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5503/fsciuto.html\" nodeid=\"5503\">@fs</a>ourcesite12345 = 'MySite2'</p> \n<p>On the search results page, I have a facet which is driven by the <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5503/fsciuto.html\" nodeid=\"5503\">@fs</a>ourcesite12345 field.</p> \n<p>Now the question:</p> \n<p>I would like to send the site name ('MySite1') along with the query when using the Global Searchbox, and upon arrival on the search results page, I would like the appropriate facet option to be selected, based on the site name value.</p> \n<p>Expanding on the developers tutorial example, I tried adding &aq=(@fsourcesite12345==\"MySite1\") to the end of the url generation, but when I arrived on the query results page and inspected the REST query object, my aq parameter was not included in the aq field.</p> \n<p>Any thoughts?</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p> Jordan</p> </li> \n</ul>\n                </div>",
