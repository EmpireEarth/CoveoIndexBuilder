We have an internal search for employees which we call AgentSearch. Both of these pipelines include Salesforce Knowledge as one of the sources.</p>\n<p>Internal Notes on Salesforce knowledge should not be part of search consideration on PublicSearch, as these internal notes are not ever shown to the user when they view articles and contains content that the end user should never be able to see or search for.</p>\n<p>Internal users, can view this info while logged in to SF and they should be able to search this field in our Coveo AgentSearch pipeline because they are employees and should be able to find items with the AgentSearch pipeline by searching for things that may appear in the internal notes.</p>\n<p>I have been asking around on how to implement this and have not gotten a good answer yet. Seems that there should be a way to specify what fields are part of search consideration, at the pipeline level. I have not found any way to do this.</p>\n<p>The only workaround I can think of is to have a duplicate source, because the only way I have found to do this is at the source, not at the pipeline.</p>\n<p>Does any one have a similar situation, and do you have any other way to accomplish this? I am not a full admin in our environment so there is much I cannot see or try</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
