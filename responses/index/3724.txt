      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>\n<p>Using Hive, CfS 4.1.82.12. I have a custom component with start and end date fields for filtering search results, both pointing to a custom date field. I have breadcrumbs populating when I select a date in my custom facet / component. However I am experiencing the following issues:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Breadcrumbs generated (manually) by my custom component cannot be cleared out. Clicking the \"Clear\" button clears out breadcrumbs for other facet selections, but not for my custom facet. </li>\n <li>Breadcrumbs duplicate when I select a date more than once. I think my issue is that I don't know how to selectively update or delete breadcrumbs (i.e just one). Also, since args.breadcrumbs is empty when I make my 2nd date selection, I can't check that and update or delete the existing breadcrumb of the same type.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Code: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/3o8pg0wa/1/\">https://jsfiddle.net/3o8pg0wa/1/</a></p>\n<p>I found <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/coveo/search-ui/blob/master/src/ui/HiddenQuery/HiddenQuery.ts#L109\">this</a>, and I was able to use some of the code from it, but I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm pretty sure the Clear button does a <code>breadcrumb.clearBreadcrumbs();</code> which doesn't even clear mine out if I run it from the console.</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
