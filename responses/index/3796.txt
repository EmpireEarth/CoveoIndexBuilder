This does prevent a yellow screen, but it results in half of the markup being sent in the response writer breaking the page on the front end. <br><br>Do you have any advice on how I can easily make all of the coveo controls fail gracefully?<br><br>Currently I'm thinking I will have to re-work them so that no server code gets executed in the Render method - i.e. move the execution of the Model.GetJavaScriptInitializationOptions() method into the page load storing the result into a property which can then be referenced in the markup.</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
