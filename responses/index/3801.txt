The reason that is important is that we generate few Link Manager driven Url's to items that do not exist in a tree like displaying a document data received from a third party for instance as a data stream based on Url params. We would want Coveo to crawl these Url's when HTML indexing is turned on. Does Coveo do this inherently? </p>\n<p>I see this documentation, but, does not have the info I am looking for </p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Indexing+Items+with+Basic+HTML+Content\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Indexing+Items+with+Basic+HTML+Content</a></p>\n<p>If this assumption is not true, how do I then ask Coveo to crawl these additional url's which are well not real Sitecore items? What is the best way to do this? We would want this additional crawled info to be available on the same source /index</p>\n<p>And the final thing, when crawling this special url's we would like to add some additional logic to see if this document(based on ID) has already been crawled, if, yes, we would like to skip it to avoid duplicate content, Currently, our url's have several different parameters that yield similar document content. And also need this power to add some custom data associated to this document if needed.</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
