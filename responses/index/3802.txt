We believe that error was occurring anytime a patch is pushed to salesforce and our fix was always to \"resave\" the visualforce page and it seemed to correct itself.</p>\n<p>However this time we were able to capture the stacktrace which seemed to point to Remote Actions being public over global. (error below) We changed from public to global but are struggling to test if this change will persist moving forward. We are wondering if you guys are experiencing in your Salesforce test orgs any breaks whenever patches are pushed involving changes to apex classes with Remote Actions. </p>\n<p>If so is there a way to subscribe to patches or get notified of patches so that we can be ready to test and make any changes if we see downtime in Search?</p>\n<p>If nothing else hopefully this post finds someone who has ran into a similar error problem.</p>Remote Action method must be global in a global componentError is in expression '{!filter}' in component <coveov2:jssearchnoform> in component coveov2:jssearch Error is in expression '{!filter}' in component <coveov2:jssearchnoform> in component coveov2:searchinterface Error is in expression '{!searchFilter}' in component <coveov2:jssearchnoform> in page comm_searchmain Error occurred loading controller 'Comm_SearchMain' for page comm_searchmain\n<p> \n<p>An unexpected error has occurred.
