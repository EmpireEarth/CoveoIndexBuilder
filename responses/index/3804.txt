If not, is there a formula to adjust it in Excel? I frequently export reports w/date and time searches but a lot of the search results show after business hours (8 pm EST). Since the search time is misleading the data is being questioned. I've searched online for excel formulas but what I have found says it's not possible. I can't believe I am the only one that wants to have accurate date/time stamps... </p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated! </p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
