I was previously working with a different release of 4.0 or 4.1 for a POC (not sure exactly which version it was), and I was using the Filter expression rules in the parameters for the Search View. Now, however, there's just \"Boost expression rules\" and I cannot find \"Filter expression rules\". The documentation (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Adding+Filtering+or+Boosting+Expressions\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Adding+Filtering+or+Boosting+Expressions</a>) seems to suggest it should be where I'm looking. Has it moved? Where has it moved to?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/storage/attachments/274-no-query-filter.png\"></p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
