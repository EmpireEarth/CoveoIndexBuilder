I know this is possible, because the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://search.coveo.com/\">http://search.coveo.com/</a> page has a Site facet that includes sub-domains of coveo.com, and external pages (e.g. the GitHub page). I've set up external sources for the three external pages I need to include using the Web connector. </p>\n<p>I'm getting tripped up on the field aspect of setting up this facet. I know it is possible to set up external fields, or Sitecore fields that can also be external, but I'm not sure what that field would be and how it would get populated. Right now I'm using syssource, which only includes the content sources. </p>\n<p>If you could provide a link to the documentation that accomplishes this task, that would be helpful; I did find this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Using+External+Content+in+Sitecore+Facets,\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SitecoreV4/Using+External+Content+in+Sitecore+Facets,</a> but that's also only on a content source level, so I don't think sub-domains would work in that example.</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
