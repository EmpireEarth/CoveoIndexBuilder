The user wants to see the following:</p>\n<pre>Cars\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Electric\n</pre>\n<p>In addition to this happening on selecting Electric it woudl also need to work when the user arrives at the page via the query string (e.g. /search#f:cars=[Electric]).</p>\n<p>Does anyone know if this functionality exists (e.g. through a config option) or how feasible it would be to implement? </p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
