      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>\n<p>Hello everyone</p>\n<p>We have setup some multi value facets that are based on an item which can have children and those children can in turn have children. The problem we're experiencing is when you select what would be the parent it will also check off all of the children. This in turn causes the breadcrumb to list every child option which creates a long list of breadcrumbs. The client is not happy with this and wishes to only show the parent as selected with only that item in the bread crumbs.</p>\n<p>To furthur illustrate the problem lets say we have an item in Sitecore called cars. That item houses numerous car types and then each of those will house the individual cars of those types.</p>\n<p>For example, lets say we have this structure inside of Sitecore</p>\n<pre>Cars/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Sports Cars/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Ford Mustang\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Porche 911\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 370Z\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 GT-R\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SUVs/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Jeep Patriot\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Jeep Renegade\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Vans/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Sprinter\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Cube Van\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Caravan\n</pre>\n<p>This in turn creates a similar structure in our Car facet. If a user expands cars then SUVs and selects Jeep Patriot only that item is checked and only that item appears in the breadcrumb. If instead they were to expand Cars and select SUVs it would also select all the SUVs giving you all three items in the breadcrumb. This doesn't look terrible in our above example data however in production there are dozens if not hundreds of child items which can create massive breadcrumbs.</p>\n<p>Is there any way to override this logic so that only the parent is selected and in turn only that one selection appears in the breadcrumb?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
