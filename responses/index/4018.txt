We are trying to add the objecttype, which is a field I can see is already indexed by Coveo currently. The Salesforce piece to set it up was easy enough but after following the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SalesforceV2/Customizing+the+AttachToCase\">https://developers.coveo.com/display/public/SalesforceV2/Customizing+the+AttachToCase</a> article and adjusting the Insight Panel, the objecttype field still comes through as blank. It seems like a straight forward article but seems we are still missing a piece.</p>\n<p>Coveo for Salesforce, version 2.24, hybrid environment on-premises</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
