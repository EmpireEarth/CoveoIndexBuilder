The facet seems to be having some trouble. The facet contains a lot of # symbols, and random numbers.</p> \n<p>Example - If I were to add \"Cashiering; Transfers\" to a list item's enterprise keywords, then it may show up as the following independent facet items.</p> \n<pre><code> #170\n Cashiering\n #Transfers\n\n</code></pre> \n<p>So, about the first 15 items in our multi-value facet are #'s and random numbers. Then, there's a list of #'s with keywords next to them. And lastly, all of the other keywords that show up normally as we'd like them to.</p> \n<p>Is this something that anyone else has encountered before? Is it caused by the use of an enterprise keyword field in SharePoint instead of a normal text field? We've had a lot of trouble with the keyword field in InfoPath, and Designer. So, my first assumption is that it might have something to do with that field. </p> \n<p>This SharePoint field does automatically place spaces between keywords. Is that an issue? Should there not be a space such as \"Cashiering;Transfers\"? </p> \n<p>Thanks!</p>\n                </div>",
