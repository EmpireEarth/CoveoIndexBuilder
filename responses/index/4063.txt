Then it suggests or just shows as the top search result a link to google maps (it could also show a specified article or data record that contains the link). I am not sure if this is possible with this suggestion component. Ideally, it would also not be needed to define all city names but rather define that it should react to city names (I know this is asking a lot, maybe it also could work alternatively on certain specified word like “city” “map”)<br><br>Additionally, if this is not available on express, what version would this be possible on?</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
