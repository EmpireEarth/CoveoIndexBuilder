      "questionbodyhtml" : "<div class=\"question-body\">\n                <p>\n<p>Hi There!</p>\n<p>Currently traditional Coveo facets, when there is more than one on the page, say user picks a value on Coveo Facet available options, the other coveo facets react to this new query fired out and adjust their available options according the query. How come this logic does not apply to sliders? Like when a facet selection is made, the facet slider range should also change based on result set, but, it seems like currently the min/max are still per initial load which I think is grabbed from index. </p>\n<p>This is not intuitive, also the min/max does not seem to consider initial query fired by Coveo view to compute that min/max and is run against the whole index. Kind of becomes not so useful in use cases where were are not worried about that field's value across index and would rather need based on result set. </p>\n<p>How can we approach this? Any thoughts or input? Could not find much information on this on Coveo documentation either, played with some advanced settings, but, this behavior is not affected. </p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
