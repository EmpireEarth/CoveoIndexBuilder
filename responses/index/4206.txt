Why is the query count not equal to the sum of manual plus refined? What other types of queries are there, and why are these not showing up in the reports in a proper bucket/grouping so that the data makes sense and adds up? </p> \n<p>There should be another bucket that includes the grouping of the extra ones that do not fit in the manual or refined buckets (my GUESS is the rest are ones done in code or behind the scenes somehow not done directly by the user typing or clicking). </p>\n                </div>",
