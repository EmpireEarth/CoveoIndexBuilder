I scanned through documentation, but, no luck so far. I would like to basically append more condition to what the Facet Slider generates when filter is manipulated by user. </p>\n<p>Currently say the slider appends the below to aq. </p>\n<p> (@fmcoveofieldone38398==635480..3214450.8000000003) </p>\n<p>I would actually need to edit it to something like this, so aq looks like below. I obviously can not achieve by simply appending my new filter to universal aq when query building as it wont be OR'd at appropriate location. I would like to edit aq generated specifically by the slider. </p>\n<p> (@fmcoveofieldone38398==635480..3214450.8000000003 OR <a rel=\"user\" href=\"/users/5508/fmarkovic.html\" nodeid=\"5508\">@fm</a>coveofieldtwofdkjdsf ==635480..3214450.8000000003)</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
