I've got a number of metadata properties all of which include colons. Examples include:</p>\n<pre><meta property=\"article:tag\" content=\"featured\" /><meta property=\"article:tag\" content=\"smart city\" /><meta property=\"article:section\" content=\"Thought Leaders\" /><meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2017-10-26T13:04:39+00:00\" /></pre>\n<p>I've tried using rules in the format <code>%[article:section]</code>, as well as <code>%[section]</code>, neither seems to work. Is there an issue because these are \"property\" values,not \"name\"? Or am I missing something in the formatting of the rule?</p>\n<p>Below is the only help I could find on the issue, but, I am really struggling to understand how to apply this in my examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>When your metadata includes a colon, you must be careful when formatting your rule because the keyword following the last colon is interpreted as the metadata origin. Therefore, if you wish to keep the colon in your metadata name, you must include an origin in the placeholder to disambiguate the rule format.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul> \n <li>`%[twitter:title]` is interpreted as the metadata name and title as the metadata origin.</li>\n <li><code>%[twitter:title:crawler]</code> is interpreted as the metadata name and crawler as the metadata origin.</li>\n</ul> \n<p>\n                </div>",
