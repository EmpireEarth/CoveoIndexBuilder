Looking at the Effective Combined Permissions list for my item in the index browser, if I search for my account I see that it is marked as Allowed, so I'd expect to see the content in my search results. However, when I perform a search, the content isn't visible in the results.</p>\n<p>The only advanced expression I have in the query is that it needs to have a layout, be part of a particular site, or it needs to be in a particular path. In this case, the path qualifier comes in as well as having a layout. So nothing is immediately jumping out as to why my content wouldn't appear on the site. I can browse to the content just fine.</p>\n<p>In my Sitecore logs, I do find the following error multiple times, for user accounts I know to exist...this is a good example. I'm not sure if this error could be a reason the security isn't being honored correctly.</p>\n<pre>10804 00:00:51 ERROR An error occurred while calling method \"GetUserMembers\".\nException: Coveo.Connectors.Sitecore2.SitecoreWebServiceExceptions.SitecoreWebServiceUserNotFoundException\nMessage: The user \"xyz\\anonymous\" does not exist.\nSource: Coveo.Connectors.Sitecore2.SitecoreWebService\n   at Coveo.Connectors.Sitecore2.SitecoreWebService.Wrapper.BaseSitecoreWrapper.GetUserMembers(String p_UserName)\n   at Coveo.Connectors.Sitecore2.SitecoreWebService.SitecoreWebService.<>c__DisplayClass1d.<GetUserMembers>b__1c()\n   at Coveo.Connectors.Sitecore2.SitecoreWebService.SitecoreWebService.TryCatchWrapper[T](Func`1 p_Action, String p_MethodName)</pre>\n<p>The Coveo diagnostic page shows all green, except for the Coveo Search Web Service, which presents this error.
