On top of that, the media items appear under a shell folder even though that's not where they live in the sitecore tree: </p>\n<p><img src=\"/storage/attachments/423-env2.png\"></p>\n<p>All document links work correctly when queried from Sitecore so as far as I can tell, even the Media documents.</p>\n<p>Can someone offer information on what might cause this type of discrepancy? I am looking to understand the issue so that in the end the index matches the sitecore tree as closely as possible.</p>\n<p>thank you.</p> \n<p>\n                </div>",
