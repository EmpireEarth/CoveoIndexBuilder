      "sfdetailsc" : "With the launch of any new system or tool comes the challenge of change management and it is not very different when you launch your first Coveo experience, be it an intelligent workspace, intelligent self-service, intelligent site search or intelligent customer support. User adoption is a very important yet sometimes neglected aspect of any new product or process launch. We want our end-users to start using the new tool or system but often forget that adopting anything new takes effort and wouldn&#39;t we all just keep doing what we&#39;re already comfortable with rather than change ? We should always try to answer a very basic question for users, what&#39;s in it for them?<br><br>Here we discuss a few tried and tested methods around communication that will make the Coveo launch a successful one for all stakeholders. Most concepts here are inspired from the <a href=\"http://library.serviceinnovation.org/KCS_Practices_Guide_v6\" target=\"_blank\">KCS (Knowledge Centered Services) Practices Guide</a> and the <a href=\"http://library.serviceinnovation.org/KCS_Adoption_Guide\" target=\"_blank\">KCS Adoption Guide</a> that talk extensively around adoption for KCS but the same scenarios and challenges apply here as well.    \n<h3><b>The Circle of User Feedback </b></h3>\nUser feedback isn&#39;t just important after you&#39;ve gone live, it is important to capture feedback at every stage of your project. Why? Here&#39;s why.\n\n<ol><li><b>Feedback collected before project launch</b> provides important input for the first and a very important stage of your project - Requirements gathering. It makes sense to capture current challenges to build a user-centric product. Some examples of questions to ask could be. What are your current challenges with finding the right information ? To which the answers could vary from information being outdated to not having access to the right systems, not knowing where to find what. Building a system for the users that solves their current challenges will ensure better adoption and will instill a sense of trust in them to provide further feedback.</li><li><b>Feedback collected mid-project / Phased rollout</b>: Now that you are building a user centric product, it is important to do a test run of what you have built before making it available to all users. Not to be dramatic but wouldn&#39;t you want to do a test run before you roll out something to your entire organization. This doesn&#39;t just mean user acceptance testing, it is aimed at collecting feedback and taking concrete steps to resolve them. Users involved in the test run will be the pioneers and will be the first ones to spread the word. </li><li><b>Feedback after launch : </b>Feedback after launch is essential in fine tuning your search results to make sure users always see relevant result set for their queries. Minor UI improvements / changes can improve productivity by leaps and bounds. Coveo analytics provides a rich set of data points for you to analyze user behavior but direct user feedback helps you close that loop. </li></ol>\n\n<h3><b>Leave nothing to be guessed </b></h3>\nGetting your users ready for the change is the key to early adoption hence constant communication throughout the project lifecycle is important.Some key messages to relay \n\n<ol><li>What are the challenges that the new search will eradicate? </li><li>Why did your company invest in Coveo ?
