Your agent could make a mistake and select the wrong origin<br><br>3) Time zone<br>Make sure both systems use the same time zone when comparing the results<br><br>4) Multiple submit actions<br>Some implementations does not grey out the submit button after submitting the case and customer can click multiple time the submit button<br><br>5) Two submits in the same visit<br>Unusual but it can happen where a customer enters 2 cases in one single visit. We use visit card to calculate case submit and this scenario, we would be short of 1 case.<br>We will soon add a reset visit after a customer submits a case to avoid that situation. As soon as a customer would submit his case and want to open the second case, they would be in two different visits.<br><br>6) Implementation issue <br>Select a day where you don&#39;t have too much case traffic. Export the username, date and subject of your case in Salesforce and Coveo.<br>Compare both lists. Once you find a case that is missing in Coveo, open visit browser on that date and search for the username. The case creation page track a lot of even before the submit.<br>You should see at least 1 search from this user in the case creation page. If there is no trace of this user, it would be an indicator that this user never went through the case creation page of Coveo.<br>If you have a trace of this user but the submit is missing, please log a case with Coveo support team.<br><br><br> ",
