This will search for occurrences of the exact sentence (in the correct order of words) within the index. If a query is not placed in quotation marks (not an exact match) it will search the index for occurrences of all the words in the query but they don&#39;t have to be in the correct order or even close to each other. As you may notice, an exact match is a lot more specific than a normal query and will return a lot less results.\\u00a0<br><br>The more words there are, the more specific the query is. The more specific a query is, the less results it will return. This is why stationnary 6 school\\u00a0is less specific than stationnary 6\\u00a0school\\u00a0walking and returns more results. However, &quot;stationnary 6\\u00a0school&quot; is an exact match and will therefore return less results than the former ones since the order of the words and their proximity cannot be changed.\\u00a0<br><br>With the type of thesaurus you selected, the query to the index is composed of 2 parts:\\u00a0<br>- Part A: the term entered in the search box\\u00a0<br>- Part B: the list of synonyms associated with that term.\\u00a0<br><br>If part A matches an entry in the thesaurus, the index will add part B to the search terms using a logic operator.\\u00a0<br><br>The query will thus become as following:\\u00a0<br>Part A (stationnary 6\\u00a0walking) + Part B (&quot;stationnary 6\\u00a0walking school&quot; OR &quot;stationnary6\\u00a0walking school&quot; OR &quot;stationnary walking school&quot;, etc...)\\u00a0<br>As you can see, Part B will always return the same number of results (in your case 117), Part A is the one that causes the discrepancy.\\u00a0<br><br>If Part A is contained within Part B, you won&#39;t have more results (ex: &quot;stationnary 6\\u00a0walking school&quot;)\\u00a0<br>If Part A would return results that are not included in Part B, those results will be added to the ones returned by the index (ex: stationnary 6\\u00a0walking)\\u00a0<br><br>The trick here is that when a synonym that contains more than one word is entered in the thesaurus, it&#39;s automatically considered as an exact match and entered as such (with quotation marks).\\u00a0<br>Hence, when you search for a synonym without putting it inside quotation marks, it will be matched with the list but won&#39;t be switched to an exact match. You will then get all the results for Part B plus all the results from part A which, according to the criteria explained above, is a lot less specific than everything in part B and returns more results.\\u00a0<br><br>In short, when inputting the following search terms:\\u00a0<br>stationnary 6\\u00a0walking - 1000 results -&gt; Part A (stationnary 6\\u00a0walking ) will add 883 results\\u00a0<br>stationnary 6\\u00a0walking school- 143 results -&gt; Part A (stationnary 6\\u00a0walking school) will add 26 results\\u00a0<br>&quot;stationnary 6\\u00a0walking &quot; - 117 results -&gt; Part A (&quot;stationnary 6\\u00a0walking&quot;) will add 0 results as it&#39;s listed in the synonyms.\\u00a0<br>&quot;stationnary 6\\u00a0walking school&quot; - 117 results -&gt; Part A (&quot;stationnary 6\\u00a0walking school&quot;) will add 0 results as it&#39;s listed in the synonyms.\\u00a0<br><br>The only way we could ensure that \\u2018stationnary 6\\u00a0walking school\\u2019 returns the same results as \\u2018stationnary 6\\u00a0walking \\u2019 (both without quotation marks) would be to exclude Part A from the query expression every time there is a match with the thesaurus. However, this functionality is not available out of the box and its custom implementation would fall out of support scope.\\u00a0<br><br>In conclusion, this behavior is expected and can only be fixed by a custom implementation. This custom implementation can be done either by yourself or by our Professional Services department.

      "sfcausec" : "An exact match is a query within quotation marks. This will search for occurrences of the exact sentence (in the correct order of words) within the index. If a query is not placed in quotation marks (not an exact match) it will search the index for occurrences of all the words in the query but they don&#39;t have to be in the correct order or even close to each other. As you may notice, an exact match is a lot more specific than a normal query and will return a lot less results. <br><br>The more words there are, the more specific the query is. The more specific a query is, the less results it will return. This is why stationnary 6 school is less specific than stationnary 6 school walking and returns more results. However, &quot;stationnary 6 school&quot; is an exact match and will therefore return less results than the former ones since the order of the words and their proximity cannot be changed. <br><br>With the type of thesaurus you selected, the query to the index is composed of 2 parts: <br>- Part A: the term entered in the search box <br>- Part B: the list of synonyms associated with that term. <br><br>If part A matches an entry in the thesaurus, the index will add part B to the search terms using a logic operator. <br><br>The query will thus become as following: <br>Part A (stationnary 6 walking) + Part B (&quot;stationnary 6 walking school&quot; OR &quot;stationnary6 walking school&quot; OR &quot;stationnary walking school&quot;, etc...) <br>As you can see, Part B will always return the same number of results (in your case 117), Part A is the one that causes the discrepancy. <br><br>If Part A is contained within Part B, you won&#39;t have more results (ex: &quot;stationnary 6 walking school&quot;) <br>If Part A would return results that are not included in Part B, those results will be added to the ones returned by the index (ex: stationnary 6 walking) <br><br>The trick here is that when a synonym that contains more than one word is entered in the thesaurus, it&#39;s automatically considered as an exact match and entered as such (with quotation marks). <br>Hence, when you search for a synonym without putting it inside quotation marks, it will be matched with the list but won&#39;t be switched to an exact match. You will then get all the results for Part B plus all the results from part A which, according to the criteria explained above, is a lot less specific than everything in part B and returns more results. <br><br>In short, when inputting the following search terms: <br>stationnary 6 walking - 1000 results -&gt; Part A (stationnary 6 walking ) will add 883 results <br>stationnary 6 walking school- 143 results -&gt; Part A (stationnary 6 walking school) will add 26 results <br>&quot;stationnary 6 walking &quot; - 117 results -&gt; Part A (&quot;stationnary 6 walking&quot;) will add 0 results as it&#39;s listed in the synonyms. <br>&quot;stationnary 6 walking school&quot; - 117 results -&gt; Part A (&quot;stationnary 6 walking school&quot;) will add 0 results as it&#39;s listed in the synonyms. <br><br>The only way we could ensure that ‘stationnary 6 walking school’ returns the same results as ‘stationnary 6 walking ’ (both without quotation marks) would be to exclude Part A from the query expression every time there is a match with the thesaurus. However, this functionality is not available out of the box and its custom implementation would fall out of support scope. <br><br>In conclusion, this behavior is expected and can only be fixed by a custom implementation. This custom implementation can be done either by yourself or by our Professional Services department. This is a billable service however. ",
