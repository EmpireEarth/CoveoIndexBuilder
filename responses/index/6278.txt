      "ytdescription" : "If your organization uses Google's G Suite of apps to manage infrastructure and information, you can incorporate the content stored on your G Suite Drive (a.k.a. Drive for Work) into your Coveo index in just a few steps.<br /><br />Configuring the Coveo side of the connector is easy. This video covers that aspect, as well as the task of configuring a crawl account to use within G Suite in order to index all data and capture ownership/permissions.<br /><br />Please continue reading for a transcript of the video.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hello and welcome to Coveo Bite Sized Learnings.<br /><br />Today we are talking about configuring a source with our Google Drive for Work connector to allow you to index your intranet content. This connector is available in Coveo Cloud V2, in both the Enterprise and Pro Editions<br /><br />Coveo Bite Sized Learnings are as short as they are sweet, so let's get started.<br /><br />As we've seen before, adding a new source is easy: once you're logged in and on the Sources page of the Coveo Cloud V2 Console, just click on ADD SOURCE, and then choose the Drive for Work connector. Once we've chosen that option, as with other sources, we give it a name, and then we provide the Google Apps domain we are building this for. In this example, we have a client, Bob, who runs a company called All-Of-Your-Stuff-DOT-Online. They store most of their own stuff in Google Drive, so they want to be able to index it. Bob is the primary G Suite administrator, so we can set his email in the Google Apps administrator account email field.<br /><br />At this point, we have to ask Bob to set us up with a crawling account. We can see that he is logged into the Google Apps admin console, and we are going to ask him to start this process by logging into the Google Developer console as well. <br /><br />Due to limits on YouTube video descriptions, the transcript of the G Suite side of the configurations is not included. Please consult our documentation at the following URL for assistance with these steps.<br /><br />https://onlinehelp.coveo.com/en/cloud/add_edit_drive_for_work_source.htm<br /><br />Back in the Coveo Cloud V2 Console, we just need to finish up our configurations. We'll start by entering the service account email that Bob would have copied and forwarded do us, and importing the p12 file that he would have forwarded as well, and we're down to the last few steps.<br /><br />For security, we can choose Secured, which means that Coveo will index the permissions provided by Google Drive for Work, and will use those to determine who sees what. If we want to make all documents available to anyone who has access to our search content, we can choose Shared instead. We will leave this as Secured for now.<br /><br />If we want to limit the content we index based on user identity, we can do so in the Users to Include menu. We'll go ahead and leave it at the default of All Users for now.<br /><br />There is also an option to include additional content, such as trashed items and custom properties. Custom properties are metadata which may be associated with your documents based on custom G Suite applications. Since this can increase indexing time, we do not recommend using this option unless it is absolutely necessary. I'll leave it turned off here.<br /><br />Finally, we'll click add and build, and within a few minutes--compressed here into a few seconds--we'll see our content has been indexed and and we can verify it by going to our content browser. Since I have been doing this in the role of a Coveo admin rather than using Bob's Coveo login, all I can see is his user profile. However, since I am an admin, I can go to the more options triple dot menu, select \"Preferences\", and check the option for \"View all content\". Once I do that, I can see all of the documents that Bob and his organization have uploaded into the AllOfYourStuff.online Google Drive for Work.<br /><br />Thank you for watching this edition of Coveo Bite Size Learning.
