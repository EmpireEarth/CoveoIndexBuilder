      "ytdescription" : "Index your Sharepoint Online intranet content quickly and easily with Coveo Cloud V2. This video will walk you through the steps to get started. A transcript of the video follows.<br /><br /><br />Hello and welcome to Coveo Bite Sized Learnings.<br /><br />Today we are talking about configuring a source with our SharePoint Online connector to allow you to index your intranet content. This connector is available in Coveo Cloud V2, in both the Enterprise and Pro Editions<br /><br />Coveo Bite Sized Learnings are as short as they are sweet, so let's get started.<br /><br />As we've seen before, adding a new source is easy: once you're logged in and on the Sources page of the Coveo Cloud V2 Console, just click on ADD SOURCE, and then choose the SharePoint Online connector. Once we've chosen that option, as with other sources, we give it a name, and then we provide a URL where our SharePoint online instance can be reached.<br /><br />Over in the authentication section, you will want to configure the credentials for a crawl account which you will have already configured in your SharePoint Online farm. This crawl account will need to have SharePoint administrator permissions in Office365 for all site collections, including the root site collection, if you want to index content and security information, as well as allowing for site collection discovery.<br /><br />If you are indexing personal, user profiles, and social tags, then the minimal permissions requirement is that the account is the owner of all personal sites collections.<br /><br />The link referred to in the video regarding crawl account requirements is:<br /><br />https://onlinehelp.coveo.com/en/cloud/add_edit_sharepoint_online_source.htm#Requirements_..54<br /><br />If you are using SSO via Office365 or ADFS authentication, you can configure the Identity Provider URL and SharePoint Trust identifier here. If you are using native authentication, you can leave the defaults as shown.<br /><br />Next, you'll want to set your scope to determine if you want to index all site collections from the specified web application, all web sites within a specified collection, a specific web site and its sub-webs (or sub-sites), or a specific list or document library.<br /><br />In our case, we'll go ahead and leave it at the default and index the whole shebang.<br /><br />With regards to security, if you've got a proper crawl account configured, we typically recommend using the \"Secured\" setting, which allows us to index native permissions and use them to determine who can search what documents. If you wish instead to index a source such that only you can search it, or such that all documents are public for anyone who has access to the search page, you can do that with the Private or Shared options, respectively. I'm going to leave our setting as Secured.<br /><br />Finally, we will choose what content to include. By default, user profiles and personal sites are not included, but if you wish to do so, you can capture that information in your index. <br /><br />Please note that if you are building multiple SharePoint Online sources, you will want to make sure that you are indexing user profiles in only one of them; otherwise, you will be indexing those user profiles multiple times, potentially slowing down the indexing process and polluting your index with duplicates.<br /><br />Once you've finished these configurations, click add and build, and within a few minutes--compressed here into a few seconds--you'll see your content has been indexed and you will be able to view it in your content browser and within any search page configured to show that content.<br /><br />Thank you for watching this edition of Coveo Bite Size Learning.
