      "ytdescription" : "Coveo Cloud V2 allows you to index your documents stored in Amazon S3, Box, DropBox and Google Drive. Learn how to configure these sources quickly and easily in this short video.<br /><br />Please find a transcript of this video, below.<br /><br />Hello and welcome to Coveo Bite Sized Learnings.<br /><br />Today we are talking about configuring sources to index four cloud storage services: Amazon S3, Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. These sources are available in Coveo Cloud V2, in both the Enterprise and Pro Editions<br /><br />Coveo Bite Sized Learnings are as short as they are sweet, so let's get started.<br /><br />As we've seen before, adding a new source is easy: once you're in the Sources page of the Coveo Cloud V2 Console, just click on ADD SOURCE.<br /><br />Let's start at the top, with Amazon S3. We'll click on that, then we'll name our source, and provide the URL of our bucket. We've got a publicly available bucket with a handful of demo documents that we can crawl.<br /><br />When crawling them, we can choose whether we want these documents to be shared or private using these controls; finer grain permissions can be assigned using an index pipeline extension script if you like. This will be a topic for another bite-size learning video.<br /><br />The bucket I've listed here is publicly available, but if you're indexing one which is not, you will want to provide authentication information which you will get from your Amazon S3 account.<br /><br />Since that doesn't apply here, we'll go ahead and click Add and Build, and we're done. Super-simple.<br /><br />While that's working, we'll go ahead and start with our next one: Box.<br /><br />For this one, we need to authenticate before proceeding. Once we're in, we name the source, choose our permissions level just like with Amazon S3, and click Add and Build. Again, unless you are looking to apply custom permissions using an index pipeline extension, that's all there is to it.<br /><br />The next one we'll do is DropBox. Again, I need to log in in first, after which I can name the source, and the same permissions concepts apply. Add and build, and you'll have your content indexed shortly!<br /><br />Finally, let's do Google Drive. <br /><br />You'll see we also have a connector for Drive for Work; this connector is a bit more complex to configure so we will cover it in another Bite Size Learning Video.<br /><br />Back to google Drive, again, we authenticate per usual, then name the source. <br /><br />With Google Drive, we have an option to determine whether we want to index items that have been put in the GDrive trash, and also whether we want to index custom metadata associated with stored documents. This latter option is one that we do not recommend unless it is necessary, as it can have a significant impact on indexing time, depending upon the applications which you have linked to your Google Drive.<br /><br />Once we've selected what we want, we choose our security with the same considerations as before, and click add and build to index.<br /><br />Once we've completed this process, we can check back in a few minutes and see that our content has been indexed as expected and is ready to be searched.<br /><br />Thank you for watching this edition of Coveo Bite Size Learning.
