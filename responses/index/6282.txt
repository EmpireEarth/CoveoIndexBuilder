      "ytdescription" : "With Coveo Cloud V2, it's easy to index content housed in Atlassian's Confluence and Jira Cloud offerings. Watch this video and be up and running in just a few minutes!<br /><br />Please find a transcript of this video, below.<br /><br />Hello and welcome to Coveo Bite Sized Learnings.<br /><br />Today we are talking about configuring sources to index Atlassian's Confluence and Jira Cloud services. These sources are available in Coveo Cloud V2, in both the Enterprise and Pro Editions<br /><br />Coveo Bite Sized Learnings are as short as they are sweet, so let's get started.<br /><br />As we've seen before, adding a new source is easy: once you're in the Sources page of the Coveo Cloud V2 Console, just click on ADD SOURCE.<br /><br />Let's go ahead and start with Confluence Cloud. Once we've chosen that source, we give it a name, and our instance URL.<br /><br />When crawling this system, we can choose whether we want these documents to be shared or private using the controls I'm showing here; finer grain permissions can be assigned using an index pipeline extension script if you like. This will be a topic for another bite-size learning video.<br /><br />Now, we provide our credentials, and then choose what content to include in the crawl--here, we are sticking with the defaults, meaning that we're indexing the global space, and within that, capturing attachments and comments associated with the content.<br /><br />We also have a Space Filter option, which allows you to use a regular expression filter to limit what is being indexed in your instance. I'll go ahead and leave that one empty for now.<br /><br />Finally, I'll go ahead and click Add and Build, and we're done. It couldn't be easier!<br /><br />While that's working, let's go ahead and configure a Jira Cloud source.<br /><br />The Jira configurations are very similar to Confluence Cloud configurations. Choose the source and name it, provide an instance URL, specify permissions settings, with the same considerations as we discussed in the confluence configurations, specify authentication credentials, and then choose the type of content you wish to include. Here, I'm leaving the defaults in place, to capture attachments, comments, and work logs.<br /><br />Click Add and Build, and you're good to go.<br /><br />Check back on your Sources screen after a few minutes, and you'll see your content, fully indexed and ready to view, easily searchable in the Content browser.<br /><br />Thank you for watching this edition of Coveo Bite Size Learning.
