      "ytdescription" : "Incorporating RSS feeds into your Coveo Cloud V2 Index is incredibly easy. This video shows how to capture multiple feeds into a single Coveo RSS source.<br /><br />Please see a full transcript of the video below.<br /><br />Hello and welcome to Coveo Bite Sized Learnings.<br /><br />Today we are talking about configuring a source with our RSS connector to allow you to index feeds from various sites. This connector is available in Coveo Cloud V2, in both the Enterprise and Pro Editions<br /><br />Coveo Bite Sized Learnings are as short as they are sweet, so let's get started.<br /><br />As we've seen before, adding a new source is easy: once you're in the Sources page of the Coveo Cloud V2 Console, just click on ADD SOURCE, and then choose the RSS connector. Once we've chosen that option, as with other sources, we give it a name. I'm a big fan of Macs and iPhones, so I'm going to index the feeds of various Apple news-related sites, and I'll call my source \"iNews\".<br /><br />The next thing to do is to add a feed URL. One of my favorite sites is MacRumors; I'll go there, find the feed URL link, copy the link address, and paste it into my feed URL field in the source configuration.<br /><br />If you are indexing a feed or feeds which are password protected, you can also enter your credentials in the authentication form. The feeds I'm going to index today are all public, so we will leave that blank.<br /><br />Click Add and Build, and we're off and running.<br /><br />We'll let it go ahead and crawl for a bit, after which we'll see that several items have been indexed and are searchable in our content browser. Since that worked, I'm ready to add some other feeds to my list, so I'll go back to the source configuration page. I want to find the feed URL for Daring Fireball as well, so I'll go to that page, find the link, copy it, and paste it in the form, and save and rebuild to incorporate this new content into the same source.<br /><br />Of course, I could separate each feed out into different sources, but since it is all similar content and I am not doing anything really interesting with the indexing pipeline such as adding custom security permissions, it's easier just to keep them all in one source.<br /><br />The rebuild started, but it did not complete, apparently due to a bad feed format. Since the previous try worked, there must be something wrong at the link on Daring Fireball. I'll go back there and click on the link, where I'll find that the RSS feed link is actually an RSS feeds link--plural, that is--so I'll find the feed I want, copy that link address, and paste it into my form.<br /><br />Save and rebuild, and we can see that it completed successfully, having indexed quite a few more items.<br /><br />Now that I'm pretty confident with my configurations, I'll go ahead and add in a couple of additional sites: Asymco and MacObserver, and I think I'll be happy with that. Save and rebuild a final time, and within a few minutes we'll see that we've got a significant number of new items, and I can start searching for the things that I'm interested in.<br /><br />Thank you for watching this edition of Coveo Bite Size Learning.
